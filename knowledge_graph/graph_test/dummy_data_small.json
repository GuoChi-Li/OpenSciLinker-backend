            "abstract": "The collection of hydrological data in Italy has been managed at the national level by the National Hydrological and Mareographic Service (SIMN) since early 1900. The dismantlement of the SIMN, performed about 30 years ago, resulted in data collection being transferred to a regional level. This change has determined problems in the availability of complete and homogeneous data for the whole country. Historical hydrological measurements are usually available only in the printed version of the Hydrological Yearbooks and limited efforts have been spent to digitize this collection. Within the SIREN (Saving Italian hydRological mEasuremeNts) project we aim to digitize these data by crowd-sourcing the recovery of hydrological measurements from historical Hydrological Yearbooks to produce a consistent dataset.
