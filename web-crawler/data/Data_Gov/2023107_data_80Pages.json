The Factors are based on GHG data representing 2019. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors (SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_CO2e_USD2021.csv) provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per USD for all GHGs combined using 100 yr global warming potentials from the 4th IPPC Assessment report to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors (SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_byGHG_USD2021.csv) provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar (USD) in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices in 2021 USD.

        "description": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For the most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page (updated weekly) or Vision Zero View (updated monthly).\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department\u2019s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists. \nThe ZCTA boundaries in this release are those delineated following the 2010 Census.",

        "description": "Many organizations quantify greenhouse emissions in their value chain. Emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods, referred to as Scope 3 emissions in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard, represent a significant emissions source for many organizations. To assist in quantifying these emissions, we have developed a comprehensive set of supply chain emission factors covering all categories of goods and services in the US economy. These factors are intended for quantifying emissions from purchased goods and services using the spend-based method defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions. The factors were prepared using USEEIO models, which are a life cycle models of goods and services in the US economy.\nThe supply chain emission factors are presented in units of kilogram emissions per US dollar of purchases for a category of goods and services with a defined life cycle scope. Sets of factors covering all sectors of the economy are provided for years from 2010 to 2016 with two levels of sector aggregation. The factors are provided for both industries and commodities, where commodities are equivalent to a category of good or service, and industries are producers of one or more commodities. A set of five data quality scores covering data reliability, temporal, geographical and technological correlation and completeness of data collection is provided along with each factor.\nThe factors presented are as follows:\n1. Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins: emissions associated with cradle to factory gate\n2. Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors: emissions associated with factory gate to shelf, which includes emissions from transportation, wholesale and retail as well as adjustments for price markups\n3. Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins: emissions associated with cradle to shelf (equal to the sum of the above two factors)\nEnd users of products will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins most appropriate for their use. Organizations purchasing intermediate products at the factory gate will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins to be most appropriate.\nSee the Executive Summary of the associated report for an example calculation using the factors.\nAll factors are associated with limitations and variations in underlying data quality. We encourage the reader to carefully read the report to understand the differences across these sets, underlying assumptions in their calculation, their limitations to decide if they are appropriate for their intended use. If the reader deems the factors are appropriate, this report along with the factor data quality scores will aid in selection of factors best fit for their intended use. \nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nIngwersen, W., and M.

In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.\nThe boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2019, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).",

        "description": "The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and\n    correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use\n    of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as\n    lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco,\n    and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment\n    history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic\n    criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were\n    also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting\n    from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey, including questions asked\n    only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug\n    use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes\n    toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on\n    mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking.\n    Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to\n    measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a\n    split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.\n    Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race,\n    age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.",

Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form. The current version of the SR1050 instructions manual with detailed information on each data elements is available here.\nAs per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here.",

People who live and/or work in compact neighborhoods with a walkable street grid and easy access to public transit, jobs, stores, and services are more likely to have several transportation options to meet their everyday needs. As a result, they can choose to drive less, which reduces their emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants compared to people who live and work in places that are not location efficient. Walking, biking, and taking public transit can also save people money and improve their health by encouraging physical activity.\nThe Smart Location Database summarizes several demographic, employment, and built environment variables for every census block group (CBG) in the United States. The database includes indicators of the commonly cited \u201cD\u201d variables shown in the transportation research literature to be related to travel behavior.  The Ds include residential and employment density, land use diversity, design of the built environment, access to destinations, and distance to transit. SLD variables can be used as inputs to travel demand models, baseline data for scenario planning studies, and combined into composite indicators characterizing the relative location efficiency of CBG within U.S. metropolitan regions.\nThis update features the most recent geographic boundaries (2019 Census Block Groups) and new and expanded sources of data used to calculate variables. Entirely new variables have been added and the methods used to calculate some of the SLD variables have changed.\nMore information on the National Walkability index: https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping\nMore information on the Smart Location Calculator: https://www.slc.gsa.gov/slc/",

Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data.

Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as \u201cMorphine (not heroin).\u201d  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.\n\u201cAny Opioid\u201d \u2013 If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it\u2019s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results, that column may be checked",

In addition to the 2004 NSDUH data, the study utilized new variables that were derived from the original dataset by the principal investigator, namely recoded variables, interaction variables, and computed indices. Information was provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 years and older. Respondents also provided detailed information regarding criminal activity, depression, and other factors. A total of 55,602 respondents participated in the study. The dataset contains a total of 3,011 variables. The first 2,690 variables are drawn from the 2004 NSDUH dataset and the remaining 321 variables were created by the principal investigator.

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/us-epa-nonattainment-areas-and-designations",
        "description": "This web service contains the following state level layers:Ozone 8-hr (1997 standard), Ozone 8-hr (2008 standard), Lead (2008 standard), SO2 1-hr (2010 standard), PM2.5 24hr (2006 standard), PM2.5 Annual (1997 standard), PM2.5 Annual (2012 standard), PM10 (1987 standard), and CO (1990 standard). Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (https://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NonattainmentAreas/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. These layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants and have been designated \"nonattainment\u00e2\u0080\u009d areas (NAA)\". The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \"attainment\" (meeting), \"nonattainment\" (not meeting), or \"unclassifiable\" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to: https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/index.html. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (https://www.epa.gov/approved-sips/regional-sip-coordinators). EPA Headquarters should be contacted only when the Regional Office is unable to answer a question.",

Scientists and resource managers use 3DEP data for        hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization, and many other        applications. The elevations in this DEM represent the topographic bare-earth surface. USGS        standard one-meter DEMs are produced exclusively from high resolution light detection and        ranging (lidar) source data of one-meter or higher resolution. One-meter DEM surfaces are        seamless within collection projects, but, not necessarily seamless across projects. The        spatial reference used for tiles of the one-meter DEM within the conterminous United States        (CONUS) is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) in units of meters, and in conformance with        the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). All bare earth elevation values are in meters and        are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). Each tile is        distributed in the UTM Zone in which it lies. If a tile crosses two UTM zones, it is        delivered in both zones. The one-meter DEM is the highest resolution standard DEM offered in        the 3DEP product suite. Other 3DEP products are nationally seamless DEMs in resolutions of        1/3, 1, and 2 arc seconds. These seamless DEMs were referred to as the National Elevation        Dataset (NED) from about 2000 through 2015 at which time they became the seamless DEM layers        under the 3DEP program and the NED name and system were retired. Other 3DEP products include        five-meter DEMs in Alaska as well as various source datasets including the lidar point cloud        and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Ifsar) digital surface models and intensity        images. All 3DEP products are public domain.",

For the 2010 Census and beyond, tribal census tracts are defined independently of the standard county-based census tract  delineation. For federally recognized American Indian Tribes with reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands with a population less than 2,400, a single tribal census tract is defined. Qualifying areas with a population greater than 2,400 could define additional tribal census tracts within their area. The tribal census tract codes for the 2020 Census are six characters long with a leading \"T\" alphabetic character followed by a five-digit numeric code, for example, T01000, which translates as tribal census tract 10. Tribal block groups nest within tribal census tracts.

This indicator is based on the question: \"\u201cHas a doctor, nurse or other health professional EVER told you that you have a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression)?\u201d NOTE: Denominator data and weighting was taken from the California Department of Finance, not U.S. Census. Values may therefore differ from what has been published in the national BRFSS data tables by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other federal agencies.",

The NIS is designed to produce U.S. regional and national estimates of inpatient utilization, access, cost, quality, and outcomes. Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7 million hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations nationally. Developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), HCUP data inform decision making at the national, State, and community levels.\nStarting with the 2012 data year, the NIS is a sample of discharges from all hospitals participating in HCUP, covering more than 97 percent of the U.S. population. For prior years, the NIS was a sample of hospitals. The NIS allows for weighted national estimates to identify, track, and analyze national trends in health care utilization, access, charges, quality, and outcomes. The NIS's large sample size enables analyses of rare conditions, such as congenital anomalies; uncommon treatments, such as organ transplantation; and special patient populations, such as the uninsured. NIS data are available since 1988, allowing analysis of trends over time. \nThe NIS inpatient data include clinical and resource use information typically available from discharge abstracts with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources).  Data elements include but are not limited to: diagnoses, procedures, discharge status, patient demographics (e.g., gender, age), total charges, length of stay, and expected payment source, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay, or those billed as \u2018no charge\u2019. The NIS excludes data elements that could directly or indirectly identify individuals. \nRestricted access data files are available with a data use agreement and brief online security training.",

        "description": "Note: This dataset has been superseded by the dataset found at \"End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock\" (submission 4520; linked in the submission resources), which is a comprehensive and validated representation of hourly load profiles in the U.S. commercial and residential building stock. The End-Use Load Profiles project website includes links to data viewers for this new dataset. For documentation of dataset validation, model calibration, and uncertainty quantification, see Wilson et al. (2022). \nThese  data were first created around 2012 as a byproduct of various analyses of solar photovoltaics and solar water heating (see references below for are two examples).  This dataset contains several errors and limitations. It is recommended that users of this dataset transition to the updated version of the dataset posted in the resources.  This dataset contains weather data, commercial load profile data, and residential load profile data.\nWeather\nThe Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3) provides one year of hourly data for around 1,000 locations. The TMY weather represents 30-year normals, which are typical weather conditions over a 30-year period.\nCommercial\nThe commercial load profiles included are the 16 ASHRAE 90.1-2004 DOE Commercial Prototype Models simulated in all TMY3 locations, with building insulation levels changing based on ASHRAE 90.1-2004 requirements in each climate zone. The folder names within each resource represent the weather station location of the profiles, whereas the file names represent the building type and the representative city for the ASHRAE climate zone that was used to determine code compliance insulation levels. As indicated by the file names, all building models represent construction that complied with the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 building energy code requirements. No older or newer vintages of buildings are represented.\nResidential \nThe BASE residential load profiles are five EnergyPlus models (one per climate region) representing 2009 IECC construction single-family detached homes simulated in all TMY3 locations. No older or newer vintages of buildings are represented. Each of the five climate regions include only one heating fuel type; electric heating is only found in the Hot-Humid climate. Air conditioning is not found in the Marine climate region.\nOne major issue with the residential profiles is that for each of the five climate zones, certain location-specific algorithms from one city were applied to entire climate zones. For example, in the Hot-Humid files, the heating season calculated for Tampa, FL (December 1 - March 31) was unknowingly applied to all other locations in the Hot-Humid zone, which restricts heating operation outside of those days (for example, heating is disabled in Dallas, TX during cold weather in November). This causes the heating energy to be artificially low in colder parts of that climate zone, and conversely the cooling season restriction leads to artificially low cooling energy use in hotter parts of each climate zone. Additionally, the ground temperatures for the representative city were used across the entire climate zone. This affects water heating energy use (because inlet cold water temperature depends on ground temperature) and heating/cooling energy use (because of ground heat transfer through foundation walls and floors). Representative cities were Tampa, FL (Hot-Humid), El Paso, TX (Mixed-Dry/Hot-Dry), Memphis, TN (Mixed-Humid), Arcata, CA (Marine), and Billings, MT (Cold/Very-Cold).\nThe residential dataset includes a HIGH building load profile that was intended to provide a rough approximation of older home vintages, but it combines poor thermal insulation with larger house size, tighter thermostat setpoints, and less efficient HVAC equipment. Conversely, the LOW building combines excellent thermal insulation with smaller house size, wider thermostat setpoints, and more efficient HVAC equipment. However, it is not known how well these HIGH and LOW permutations represent the range of energy use in the housing stock.\nNote that on July 2nd, 2013, the Residential High and Low load files were updated from 366 days in a year for leap years to the more general 365 days in a normal year. The archived residential load data is included from prior to this date.",

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). In addition to the standard set of normals, users also can find \"agricultural normals\", which are used in many industries, including but not limited to construction, architecture, pest control, etc. These supplemental \"agricultural normals\" include frost-freeze date probabilities, growing degree day normals, probabilities of reaching minimum temperature thresholds, and growing season length normals. Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP).

The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as a Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG), including an updated wildfire-cause standard (approved August 2020). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible.

Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries.

        "description": "Updates are delayed due to technical difficulties.\nHow many people are staying at home? How far are people traveling when they don\u2019t stay home? Which states and counties have more people taking trips? The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) now provides answers to those questions through our new mobility statistics.\nThe Trips by Distance data and number of people staying home and not staying home are estimated for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. Data analysis is conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels. A weighting procedure expands the sample of millions of mobile devices, so the results are representative of the entire population in a nation, state, or county. To assure confidentiality and support data quality, no data are reported for a county if it has fewer than 50 devices in the sample on any given day.\nTrips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. Home locations are imputed on a weekly basis. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes before returning home is counted as multiple trips. Trips capture travel by all modes of transportation. including driving, rail, transit, and air.\nThe daily travel estimates are from a mobile device data panel from merged multiple data sources that address the geographic and temporal sample variation issues often observed in a single data source. The merged data panel only includes mobile devices whose anonymized location data meet a set of data quality standards, which further ensures the overall data quality and consistency. The data quality standards consider both temporal frequency and spatial accuracy of anonymized location point observations, temporal coverage and representativeness at the device level, spatial representativeness at the sample and county level, etc. A multi-level weighting method that employs both device and trip-level weights expands the sample to the underlying population at the county and state levels, before travel statistics are computed.\nThese data are experimental and may not meet all of our quality standards.  Experimental data products are created using new data sources or methodologies that benefit data users in the absence of other relevant products. We are seeking feedback from data users and stakeholders on the quality and usefulness of these new products. Experimental data products that meet our quality standards and demonstrate sufficient user demand may enter regular production if resources permit.",

These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.\nThe generalized ZCTA boundaries in this file are based on those delineated following the 2010 Census.",

The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself.

Firearm counts are derived from taking the number of violent crimes which involve a firearm. Population data are provided every year by the FBI, based on US Census information.

        "description": "This dataset contains individual-level homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, including homicide data from 1991 to the present, and non-fatal shooting data from 2010 to the present (2010 is the earliest available year for shooting data). This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request. To make a request, please email dataportal@cityofchicago.org with the subject line: Violence Reduction Victims Access Request. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:\n\nIn instances where a homicide victimization does not correspond to an IUCR code 0110 or 0130, we set the IUCR code to \"01XX\"  to indicate that the victimization was a homicide but we do not know whether it was a first-degree murder",

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2018 or 2017 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates.

Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2015 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the county level.

The dataset was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate were assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined.\nMap unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the entire map unit.\nThis dataset consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national dataset. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information system relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.  \nThese data provide information about soil features on or near the surface of the Earth. Data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state, regional, and national level.

This dataset is created using data from the California Electronic Death Registration System (CA-EDRS) via the Vital Records Business Intelligence System (VRBIS). Substance-related deaths are identified by reviewing the cause of death. Deaths caused by opioids, methamphetamine, and cocaine are included. Homicides and suicides are excluded. Ethnic and racial groups with fewer than 10 events are not tallied separately for privacy reasons but are included in the \u201call races\u201d total.   \nUnintentional drug overdose death rates are calculated by dividing the total number of overdose deaths by race/ethnicity by the total population size for that demographic group and year and then multiplying by 100,000. The total population size is based on estimates from the US Census Bureau County Population Characteristics for San Francisco, 2022 Vintage by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. \nThese data differ from the data shared in the  Preliminary Unintentional Drug Overdose Death by Year dataset  since this dataset uses finalized counts of overdose deaths associated with cocaine, methamphetamine, and opioids only.  \nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED \nThis dataset is created by copying data from the Annual Substance Use Trends in San Francisco report from the San Francisco Department of Public Health Center on Substance Use and Health. \nC.

        "description": "The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a comprehensive aggregated collection of hydrologic unit data consistent with the national criteria for delineation and resolution. It defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point except in coastal or lake front areas where there could be multiple outlets as stated by the \"Federal Standards and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)\" \"Standard\" (https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/11/a3/). Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. This dataset represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the 12-digit for the entire United States. Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. WBD line attributes contain the highest level of hydrologic unit for each boundary, line source information and flow modifications.

These topics will be covered in Summary File 3. Data are available for states, counties, county subdivisions, places, census tracts, block groups, and, where applicable, American Indian and Alaskan Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands. The SF1 data are available on the Bureau's web site and may be retrieved from American FactFinder as tables, lists, or maps. Users may also download a set of compressed ASCII files for each state via the Bureau's FTP server. There are over 8000 data items available for each geographic area. The full listing of these data items is available here as a downloadable compressed data base file named TABLES.ZIP. The uncompressed is in FoxPro data base file (dbf) format and may be imported to ACCESS, EXCEL, and other software formats. While all of this information is useful, the Office of Community Planning and Development has downloaded selected information for all states and areas and is making this information available on the CPD web pages. The tables and data items selected are those items used in the CDBG and HOME allocation formulas plus topics most pertinent to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), the Consolidated Plan, and similar overall economic and community development plans. The information is contained in five compressed (zipped) dbf tables for each state. When uncompressed the tables are ready for use with FoxPro and they can be imported into ACCESS, EXCEL, and other spreadsheet, GIS and database software. The data are at the block group summary level. The first two characters of the file name are the state abbreviation. The next two letters are BG for block group. Each record is labeled with the code and name of the city and county in which it is located so that the data can be summarized to higher-level geography. The last part of the file name describes the contents . The GEO file contains standard Census Bureau geographic identifiers for each block group, such as the metropolitan area code and congressional district code. The only data included in this table is total population and total housing units. POP1 and POP2 contain selected population variables and selected housing items are in the HU file. The MA05 table data is only for use by State CDBG grantees for the reporting of the racial composition of beneficiaries of Area Benefit activities.

        "description": "Executive Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that holds promise for tremendous societal and economic benefit. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live, work, learn, discover, and communicate. AI research can further our national priorities, including increased economic prosperity, improved educational opportunities and quality of life, and enhanced national and homeland security. Because of these potential benefits, the U.S. government has invested in AI research for many years. Yet, as with any significant technology in which the Federal government has interest, there are not only tremendous opportunities but also a number of considerations that must be taken into account in guiding the overall direction of Federally-funded R&D in AI. On May 3, 2016,the Administration announced the formation of a new NSTC Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, to help coordinate Federal activity in AI.1 This Subcommittee, on June 15, 2016, directed the Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) to create a National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan. A NITRD Task Force on Artificial Intelligence was then formed to define the Federal strategic priorities for AI R&D, with particular attention on areas that industry is unlikely to address. This National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan establishes a set of objectives for Federallyfunded AI research, both research occurring within the government as well as Federally-funded research occurring outside of government, such as in academia. The ultimate goal of this research is to produce new AI knowledge and technologies that provide a range of positive benefits to society, while minimizing the negative impacts. To achieve this goal, this AI R&D Strategic Plan identifies the following priorities for Federally-funded AI research: Strategy 1: Make long-term investments in AI research. Prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a world leader in AI. Strategy 2: Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration. Rather than replace humans, most AI systems will collaborate with humans to achieve optimal performance. Research is needed to create effective interactions between humans and AI systems. Strategy 3: Understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. We expect AI technologies to behave according to the formal and informal norms to which we hold our fellow humans. Research is needed to understand the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI, and to develop methods for designing AI systems that align with ethical, legal, and societal goals. Strategy 4: Ensure the safety and security of AI systems. Before AI systems are in widespread use, assurance is needed that the systems will operate safely and securely, in a controlled, well-defined, and well-understood manner. Further progress in research is needed to address this challenge of creating AI systems that are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy. Strategy 5: Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing. The depth, quality, and accuracy of training datasets and resources significantly affect AI performance. Researchers need to develop high quality datasets and environments and enable responsible access to high-quality datasets as well as to testing and training resources. Strategy 6: Measure and evaluate AI technologies through standards and benchmarks. . Essential to advancements in AI are standards, benchmarks, testbeds, and community engagement that guide and evaluate progress in AI. Additional research is needed to develop a broad spectrum of evaluative techniques. Strategy 7: Better understand the national AI R&D workforce needs. Advances in AI will require a strong community of AI researchers. An improved understanding of current and future R&D workforce demands in AI is needed to help ensure that sufficient AI experts are available to address the strategic R&D areas outlined in this plan. The AI R&D Strategic Plan closes with two recommendations: Recommendation 1: Develop an AI R&D implementation framework to identify S&T opportunities and support effective coordination of AI R&D investments, consistent with Strategies 1-6 of this plan. Recommendation 2: Study the national landscape for creating and sustaining a healthy AI R&D workforce, consistent with Strategy 7 of this plan.",

Screen questions cover the following types of crimes, including attempts: rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.\nThe data include type of crime; severity of the crime; injuries or losses; time and place of occurrence; medical expenses incurred; number, age, race, and sex of offender(s); and relationship of offender(s) to the victim (stranger, casual acquaintance, relative, etc.). Demographic information on household members includes age, sex, race, education, employment, median family income, marital status, and military history. A stratified multistage cluster sample technique was employed, with the person-level files consisting of a full sample of victims and a 10 percent sample of nonvictims for up to four incidents.\nThe NCVS data are organized by collection quarter, and six quarters comprise an annual file. For example, for a 1979 file, the four quarters of 1979 are included as well as the first two quarters of 1980.\nNACJD has prepared a resource guide on NCVS.\nYears Produced: Updated annually",

The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas, based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.\nThe 1990 codes are similarly defined. However, the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And, census tracts changed in number and shapes. The 2000 rural-urban commuting codes are not directly comparable with the 1990 codes because of these differences.\nAn update of the Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes is planned for late 2013.",

It counts asthma-related visits to the Emergency Department (ED), hospitalizations, urgent care visits, and asthma controller medication dispensing events.\nThe asthma data was compiled as part of the Allegheny County Health Department\u2019s Asthma Task Force, which was established in 2018. The Task Force was formed to identify strategies to decrease asthma inpatient and emergency utilization among children (ages 0-18), with special focus on children receiving services funded by Medicaid. Data is being used to improve the understanding of asthma in Allegheny County, and inform the recommended actions of the task force. Data will also be used to evaluate progress toward the goal of reducing asthma-related hospitalization and ED visits.\nRegarding this data, asthma is defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (IDC-10) classification system code J45.xxx. The ICD-10 system is used to classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures in the U.S. healthcare system. \nChildren seeking care for an asthma-related claim in 2017 are represented in the data. Data is compiled by the Health Department from medical claims submitted to three health plans (UPMC, Gateway Health, and Highmark). Claims may also come from people enrolled in Medicaid plans managed by these insurers. The Health Department estimates that 74% of the County\u2019s population aged 0-18 is represented in the data.\nUsers should be cautious of using administrative claims data as a measure of disease prevalence and interpreting trends over time. Missing from the data are the uninsured, members in participating plans enrolled for less than 90 continuous days in 2017, children with an asthma-related condition that did not file a claim in 2017, and children participating in plans managed by insurers that did not share data with the Health Department. \nData users should also be aware that diagnoses may also be subject to misclassification, and that children with an asthmatic condition may not be diagnosed. It is also possible that some children may be counted more than once in the data if they are enrolled in a plan by more than one participating insurer and file a claim on each policy in the same calendar year.",

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf. Both ZIP Codes and Community Areas are also geographic datasets on this data portal.\nData Source: Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System, Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, Illinois Vital Records, American Community Survey (2018)",

Historically, USDA databases have been used for national nutrition monitoring (1). Currently, the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) (2), is used by Food Surveys Research Group, ARS, to process dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES. Nutrient values for FNDDS are based on Survey-SR. Survey-SR was referred to as the \"Primary Data Set\" in older publications. Early versions of the dataset were composed mainly of commodity-type items such as wheat flour, sugar, milk, etc. However, with increased consumption of commercial processed and restaurant foods and changes in how national nutrition monitoring data are used (1), many commercial processed and restaurant items have been added to Survey-SR.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe current version, Survey-SR 2013-2014,\u00a0is mainly based on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) 28 (2) and contains sixty-six nutrientseach for 3,404 foods. These nutrient data will be used for assessing intake data from WWEIA, NHANES 2013-2014.\u00a0Nutrient profiles were added for\u00a0265\u00a0new foods and updated for about 500 foods from the version used for the previous survey (WWEIA, NHANES 2011-12).\u00a0\u00a0New foods added include mainly commercially processed foods\u00a0such as\u00a0several gluten-free products, milk substitutes, sauces and condiments such as sriracha, pesto and wasabi, Greek yogurt, breakfast cereals, low-sodium meat products, whole grain pastas and baked products, and several beverages including bottled tea and coffee, coconut water, malt beverages, hard cider, fruit-flavored drinks, fortified fruit juices and fruit and/or vegetable smoothies. Several school lunch pizzas and chicken products, fast-food sandwiches, and new beef cuts were also added, as they are now reported more frequently by survey respondents. Nutrient profiles were updated for several commonly consumed foods such as cheddar, mozzarella and American cheese, ground beef, butter, and catsup. The changes in nutrient values may be due to reformulations in products, changes in the market shares of brands, or more accurate data. Examples of more accurate data include analytical data, market share data, and data from a nationally representative sample.",

        "description": "The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) is a unique and powerful database designed to support various types of analyses of national readmission rates for all payers and the uninsured. The NRD includes discharges for patients with and without repeat hospital visits in a year and those who have died in the hospital. Repeat stays may or may not be related. The criteria to determine the relationship between hospital admissions is left to the analyst using the NRD. This database addresses a large gap in health care data - the lack of nationally representative information on hospital readmissions for all ages.  Outcomes of interest include national readmission rates, reasons for returning to the hospital for care, and the hospital costs for discharges with and without readmissions. Unweighted, the NRD contains data from approximately 18 million discharges each year. Weighted, it estimates roughly 35 million discharges. Developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, HCUP data inform decision making at the national, State, and community levels. \nThe NRD is drawn from HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) containing verified patient linkage numbers that can be used to track a person across hospitals within a State, while adhering to strict privacy guidelines.  The NRD is not designed to support regional, State-, or hospital-specific readmission analyses.  \nThe NRD contains more than 100 clinical and non-clinical data elements provided in a hospital discharge abstract. Data elements include but are not limited to: diagnoses, procedures, patient demographics (e.g., sex, age), expected source of payer, regardless of expected payer, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay, or those billed as \u2018no charge, discharge month, quarter, and year, total charges, length of stay, and data elements essential to readmission analyses.

The investigators sought to better understand the nature of the problem and clarify the types of shooting incidents occurring in schools,  provide information on the characteristics of school shooters, and compare fatal shooting incidents to events where only injuries resulted to identify intervention points that could be exploited to reduce the harm caused by shootings. To accomplish these objectives, the investigators used quantitative multivariate and qualitative case studies research methods to document where and when school violence occurs, and highlight key incident and perpetrator level characteristics to help law enforcement and school administrators differentiate between the kinds of school shootings that exist, to further policy responses that are appropriate for individuals and communities.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hawaii-volcanism-impact-on-the-environment",
        "description": "Fewer than one hundred people have been killed by eruptions in the recorded history of Hawaii, and only one death has occurred in the 20th Century. However, the lava flows are highly destructive to populated and cultivated areas. This set depicts the negative impact of lava flows on communities, vegetation, marine life, roads, and coastlines. It also illustrates the benefits of Hawaii volcanism such as the production of geothermal power, increase in land area of the islands and other benefits. More than 270,000 people have been killed directly or indirectly by volcanic activity worldwide during the past 500 years. Nearly all of the deaths have been caused by explosive eruptions of composite volcanoes along the boundaries of the Earth's tectonic plates. Hawaii's volcanoes have more fluid, less gaseous magmas and produce quieter, less hazardous eruptions. The village of Kapoho was entirely destroyed during the 1960 eruption in the lower east rift (fissure) zone of Kilauea. In the 1980s, flows from Kilauea's east rift largely destroyed Royal Gardens and Kalapana. The March-April 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa threatened Hilo, with a population of about 40,000. Advancing nearly 26 km in about 5 days, the active flows produced a bright red glow in the night sky visible from Hilo. Much to the relief of the citizens, the flows stopped about 6.5 km short of the city's outskirts. These outskirts are built in part on the pahoehoelava (smooth ropy lava) flows produced by the 1881 eruption of Mauna Loa, indicating that Hilo is well within the reach of lava flows from the volcano. Although the destructive effects of volcanism are more obvious, volcanoes also provide many benefits to mankind. They are the major contributors to the building of continents, and all oceanic islands owe their origin directly or indirectly to volcanism. Over the billions of years of Earth's existence, water has been released from its interior by volcanoes and hot springs near volcanic intrusions. Geothermal power produced by volcanism is an inexpensive alternative energy source. The Hawaiian Islands were built over millions of years by lava flows. The lava flows have provided the fertile soil in which crops such as pineapples, sugar cane, and coffee thrive, and lush tropical vegetation flourishes. The flows start to weather quickly in areas with adequate rainfall. In some cases revegetation can begin in less than one year after the eruption. The lava flows are very fertile, especially if they have been covered by ash. The fine ash particles retain water within reach of plant roots and release plant foods such as potassium. Vegetation that has been destroyed by ash falls returns in a more luxuriant form. However in the island's arid areas, it may take thousands of years to form fertile soils from erosion and breakdown of lava. Volcanic rocks provide an abundant local source of materials for landscaping, construction, and road building. The majestic mountains andbeautiful black sand beaches of Hawaii that draw thousands of tourists each year are products of volcanism. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park provides one of the few places in the world where visitors can safely view volcanic processes. The Hawaiian volcanoes are contributing to the overall understanding of volcanoes; they provide a natural laboratory for study of the eruptivephenomena. Careful research and constant observation over long periods of time are important. From these data, volcanologists are learning to interpret activity in order to advise local officials of imminent eruptions.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/solar-footprints-in-california-e32e6",
        "description": "Solar Footprints in CaliforniaThis GIS dataset consists of polygons that represent the footprints of solar powered electric generation facilities and related infrastructure in California called Solar Footprints. The location of solar footprints was identified using other existing solar footprint datasets from various sources along with imagery interpretation analysis. CEC staff reviewed footprints identified with imagery and digitized polygons to match the visual extent of each facility. Previous datasets of existing solar footprints used to locate solar facilities include:\u00a0\u00a0GIS Layers: (1) California Solar Footprints,\u00a0(2)\u00a0UC Berkeley Solar Points, (3)\u00a0Kruitwagen et al. 2021, (4)\u00a0BLM Renewable Project Facilities, (5)\u00a0Quarterly Fuel and Energy Report (QFER)Imagery Datasets:\u00a0Esri World Imagery,\u00a0USGS National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), 2020\u00a0SENTINEL 2 Satellite Imagery, 2023Solar facilities with large footprints such as parking lot solar, large rooftop solar, and ground solar were included in the solar footprints dataset. Small scale solar (less than 0.5 acre) and residential footprints were not included. No other data was used in the production of these shapes. Definitions for the solar facilities identified via imagery are subjective and described as follows:\u00a0Rooftop Solar: Solar arrays located on rooftops of large building.\u00a0Parking lot Solar: Solar panels on parking lots roughly larger than 1 acre, or clusters of solar panels in adjacent parking lots.\u00a0Ground Solar: Solar panels located on ground roughly larger than 1 acre, or large clusters of smaller scale footprints.\u00a0Once all footprints identified by the above criteria were digitized for all California counties, the features were visually classified into ground, parking and rooftop categories. The features were also classified into rural and urban types using the 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 1490 definition for rural. In addition, the distance to the closest substation and the percentile category of this distance (e.g. 0-25th percentile, 25th-50th percentile) was also calculated. The coverage provided by this data set should not be assumed to be a complete accounting of solar footprints in California. Rather, this dataset represents an attempt to improve upon existing solar feature datasets and to update the inventory of \"large\" solar footprints via imagery, especially in recent years since previous datasets were published.\u00a0This procedure produced a total solar project footprint of 129,742 acres. Attempts to classify these footprints and isolate the large utility-scale projects from the smaller rooftop solar projects identified in the data set is difficult. The data was gathered based on imagery, and project information that could link multiple adjacent solar footprints under one larger project is not known. However, partitioning all solar footprints that are at least partly outside of the techno-economic exclusions and greater than 7 acres yields a total footprint size of 114,470 acres. These can be approximated as utility-scale footprints.\u00a0\u00a0Metadata:\u00a0(1) California Solar FootprintsAbstract: Conservation Biology Institute created this dataset of solar footprints in California after it was found that no such dataset was publicly available at the time (Dec 2015-Jan 2016). This dataset is used to help identify where current ground based, mostly utility scale, solar facilities are being constructed and will be used in a larger landscape intactness model to help guide future development of renewable energy projects. The process of digitizing these footprints first began by utilizing an excel file from the California Energy Commission with lat/long coordinates of some of the older and bigger locations. After projecting those points and locating the facilities utilizing NAIP 2014 imagery, the developed area around each facility was digitized. While interpreting imagery, there were some instances where a fenced perimeter was clearly seen and was slightly larger than the actual footprint. For those cases the footprint followed the fenced perimeter since it limits wildlife movement through the area. In other instances, it was clear that the top soil had been scraped of any vegetation, even outside of the primary facility footprint. These footprints included the areas that were scraped within the fencing since, especially in desert systems, it has been near permanently altered.\u00a0Other sources that guided the search for solar facilities included the Energy Justice Map, developed by the Energy Justice Network which can be found here:https://www.energyjustice.net/map/searchobject.php?gsMapsize=large&amp;giCurrentpageiFacilityid;=1&amp;gsTable;=facility&amp;gsSearchtype;=advancedThe Solar Energy Industries Association\u2019s \u201cProject Location Map\u201d which can be found here:\u00a0https://www.seia.org/map/majorprojectsmap.phpalso assisted in locating newer facilities along with the \"Power Plants\" shapefile, updated in December 16th, 2015, downloaded from the U.S. Energy Information Administration located here:https://www.eia.gov/maps/layer_info-m.cfmThere were some facilities that were stumbled upon while searching for others, most of these are smaller scale sites located near farm infrastructure. Other sites were located by contacting counties that had solar developments within the county. Still, others were located by sleuthing around for proposals and company websites that had images of the completed facility. These helped to locate the most recently developed sites and these sites were digitized based on landmarks such as ditches, trees, roads and other permanent structures.Metadata:\u00a0(2)\u00a0UC Berkeley Solar PointsUC Berkeley report containing\u00a0point location for energy facilities across the United States.2022_utility-scale_solar_data_update.xlsm (live.com)Metadata:\u00a0(3)\u00a0Kruitwagen et al. 2021Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy generating capacity has grown by 41 per cent per year\u00a0since 2009. Energy system projections that mitigate climate change and aid universal\u00a0energy access show a nearly ten-fold increase in PV solar energy generating capacity\u00a0by 2040. Geospatial data describing the energy system are required to manage\u00a0generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with\u00a0biodiversity, conservation and land protection priorities caused by the land-use and\u00a0land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of\u00a0solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs. Here we provide a global\u00a0inventory of commercial-, industrial- and utility-scale PV installations (that is, PV\u00a0generating stations in excess of 10 kilowatts nameplate capacity) by using a\u00a0longitudinal corpus of remote sensing imagery, machine learning and a large cloud\u00a0computation infrastructure. We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432\u00a0per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the help\u00a0of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be\u00a0423\u2009gigawatts (\u221275/+77\u2009gigawatts) at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our dataset with\u00a0estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity\u00a0to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV solar energy facilities are\u00a0sited on cropland, followed by arid lands\u00a0and grassland.

        "description": "In 2021, Allegheny County Economic Development (ACED), in partnership with Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh(URA), completed the a Market Value Analysis (MVA) for Allegheny County.  This analysis services as both an update to previous MVA\u2019s commissioned separately by ACED and the URA and combines the MVA for the whole of Allegheny County (inclusive of the City of Pittsburgh). The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality\u2019s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional community boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.  \nThis MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market. The  data used covers the 2017-2019 period, and data used in the analysis includes:\n\nResidential Real Estate Sales\nMortgage Foreclosures\nResidential Vacancy\nParcel Year Built\nParcel Condition\nBuilding Violations\nOwner Occupancy\nSubsidized Housing Units\n\nThe MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.\nPlease refer to the presentation and executive summary for more information about the data, methodology, and findings.",

        "description": "The Methow mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) sub-herd is part of the larger West Okanogan herd, the largest migratory mule deer herd in Washington State. Individuals travel as far as 65 miles twice annually between lowland winter range and higher elevation summer range (fig. 27). Mule deer wintering on the shrubsteppe dominated foothills in the lower half of the Methow valley undertake a roughly 3-week trek in mid-spring to the productive subalpine and alpine meadows of the Pasayten and Chelan Sawtooth Wilderness, and surrounding high country, with some animals traveling north into British Columbia. On summer range they mingle with deer moving up from the west side of the Okanogan valley forming an estimated summering population of between 15,000\u201325,000 animals. Currently, migrating deer in the Methow watershed do not have to contend with any known major barriers, but their movements are somewhat constrained in the lower portion of the watershed where the topography narrows the valley considerably.These data provide the location of migration routes for mule deer in the Methow population in Washington. They were developed from 321 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 97 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 2 hours.",

The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.\nThe Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department\u2019s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile refer to areas that are administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian/Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy. The State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provides the legal boundaries for the HHLs. The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineated for the 2010 Census through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) by participants from the federally recognized tribal governments. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list of federally recognized tribes and only provides legal boundary information when the tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation, or when another tribal, state, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or off-reservation trust land.\nThe boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2018, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\nThe boundaries for state-recognized American Indian reservations and for SDTSAs were delineated by a state governor-appointed liaisons for the 2010 Census through the State American Indian Reservation Program and TSAP respectively.",

        "description": "The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) 2006-10 measures the social vulnerability of U.S. counties to environmental hazards. The index is a comparative metric that facilitates the examination of the differences in social vulnerability among counties. SoVI is a valuable tool for policy makers and practitioners. It graphically illustrates the geographic variation in social vulnerability. It shows where there is uneven capacity for preparedness and response and where resources might be used most effectively to reduce the pre-existing vulnerability. SoVI also is useful as an indicator in determining the differential recovery from disasters.The index synthesizes 27 socioeconomic variables, which the research literature suggests contribute to reduction in a community's ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards. SoVI data sources include primarily those from the United States Census Bureau.The data are compiled and processed by the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. The data are standardized and placed into a principal components analysis to reduce the initial set of variables into a smaller set of statistically optimized components. Adjustments are made to the components' cardinality (positive (+) or negative (-)) to insure that positive component loadings are associated with increased vulnerability, and negative component loadings are associated with decreased vulnerability. Once the cardinalities of the components are determined, the components are added together to determine the numerical social vulnerability score for each county.SoVI 2006-10 marks a change in the formulation of the SoVI metric from earlier versions. New directions in the theory and practice of vulnerability science emphasize the constraints of family structure, language barriers, vehicle availability, medical disabilities, and healthcare access in the preparation for and response to disasters, thus necessitating the inclusion of such factors in SoVI. Extensive testing of earlier conceptualizations of SoVI, in addition to the introduction of the U.S. Census Bureau's five-year American Community Survey (ACS) estimates, warrants changes to the SoVI recipe, resulting in a more robust metric. These changes, pioneered with the ACS-based SoVI 2005-09 carry over to SoVI 2006-10, which combines the best data available from both the 2010 U.S. Decennial Census and five-year estimates from the 2006-2010 ACS.",

        "description": "Information on the past and present orientation of the Earth's magnetic field is available from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) which serves as the national data bank for geomagnetic data. The Earth's magnetic field has been measured by land surveys, ships, aircraft and satellites at hundreds of locations resulting in millions of observations. Many of the observations are of poor quality or are unevenly distributed around the globe. Because of these limiting factors and the variation of the main magnetic field with time, the Earth's field is usually approximated by mathematical models. These models, adjusted to fit selected available observations, have wide application in geophysical and space sciences. Surveyors can obtain data and information for individual specific locations worldwide. Past values of the magnetic field are available from models for areas within the conterminous U.S. from 1750 or from 1945 worldwide. These mathematical models must be periodically updated due to the changing nature of the Earth's magnetic field. NGDC maintains the models and data base of observations to track secular variation of the Earth's magnetic field. Models and software are available on-line. The global geomagnetic observations data bases for secular change studies include high-quality magnetic observations made at observatories worldwide since 1800. Other geomagnetic data bases are: IAGA Repeat Station data base which contains observations from exact reoccupations, Other land Surveys containing miscellaneous land observations worldwide since 1800 including a few thousand observations made at sea by the non-magnetic ships, Carnegie and Zarya, Vector airborne surveys from the Project Magnetic aircraft, satellite and selected marine observations. Most of the surface data are available on-line. At most locations, three magnetic elements were observed: Either declination (D), Inclination (I), and horizontal intensity (H), or declination, horizontal intensity, and vertical intensity (Z), or total intensity (F). Where possible, the values for other magnetic elements, usually the north component (X) and east component (Y), were derived by the computer. The altitude, latitude, and longitude are recorded for each observation. The observatory annual means file contains the results of more of the observatories operating since 1800. Files are revised as new data become available. Searches and plots of data from selected stations can be made. These secular change files are the principal source for tracking the long-period changes in the direction and intensity of the Earth's magnetic field. Other data include a digital bibliography of historical magnetic survey publications at NGDC and the co-located World Data Center-A. Over 750 reports published from the 1830's to 1980's were inventoried in a digital bibliography and digitally imaged in .PCX format. The digital images of these reports have been written to magnetic tape.",

        "description": "The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2014 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.\nThis study has 1 Data Set.",

This composite index was developed by U.S. EPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Research and Development in support of its Sustainable and Healthy Communities (SHC) Research. It serves as an endpoint measure for use in the creation of community decision-support tools. The HWBI characterizes community conditions in the context of the flow of economic, social and ecological services. The index calculation approach used a nested-indicator design. A decade (2000-2010) of cultural, economic, and social data were drawn from publicly available sources (e.g., US Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, American Community Survey, General Social Survey, Centers for Disease Control) to provide the foundation for well-being related indicators. Indicators are integrated into one of eight domains or sub-indices of well-being. These domains were synthesized to represent different aspects of well-being characteristics common across communities of all sizes. Service indicators reflect the availability of select socio-ecological services that influence well-being. Community decisions often result in changes in the flow of community services. Collectively, well-being and service measures provide a means to evaluate relationships between the availability of certain community services and overall well-being. Data used to generate service indicators were also collected from existing data sources. Detailed information about the attributes of the HWBI, its components and related service indicators are described in Indicators and Methods for Constructing a U.S. Human Well-being Index (HWBI) for Ecosystem Services Research (EPA/600/R-12/023. pp. 121) and Indicators and Methods for Evaluating Economic, Ecosystem and Social Services Provisioning (EPA/600/R-14/184. pp. 174), respectively.",

PPIs measure price change from the perspective of the seller. This contrasts with other measures, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), that measure price change from the purchaser's perspective. Sellers' and purchasers' prices may differ due to government subsidies, sales and excise taxes, and distribution costs.\nThere are three main PPI classification structures which draw from the same pool of price information provided to the BLS by cooperating company reporters:\n    Industry classification. A Producer Price Index for an industry is a measure of changes in prices received for the industry's output sold outside the industry (that is, its net output). The PPI publishes approximately 535 industry price indexes in combination with over 4,000 specific product line and product category sub-indexes, as well as, roughly 500 indexes for groupings of industries. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) index codes provide comparability with a wide assortment of industry-based data for other economic programs, including productivity, production, employment, wages, and earnings.\n    Commodity classification. The commodity classification structure of the PPI organizes products and services by similarity or material composition, regardless of the industry classification of the producing establishment. This system is unique to the PPI and does not match any other standard coding structure. In all, PPI publishes more than 3,700 commodity price indexes for goods and about 800 for services (seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted), organized by product, service, and end use.\n    Commodity-based Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) System. Commodity-based FD-ID price indexes regroup commodity indexes for goods, services, and construction at the subproduct class (six-digit) level, according to the type of buyer and the amount of physical processing or assembling the products have undergone. The PPI publishes over 600 FD-ID indexes (seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted) measuring price change for goods, services, and construction sold to final demand and to intermediate demand. The FD-ID system replaced the PPI stage-of-processing (SOP) system as PPI's primary aggregation model with the release of data for January 2014. The FD-ID system expands coverage in its aggregate measures beyond that of the SOP system by incorporating indexes for services, construction, exports, and government purchases.\n\nFor more information, visit: https://www.bls.gov/ppi",

The VA commitment to quality propelled the implementation of the RAI/MDS in its nursing homes now known as VA Community Living Centers (CLC). In addition to providing consistent clinical information, the RAI/MDS can be used as a measure of both quality and resource utilization, thereby serving as a benchmark for quality and cost data within the VA as well as with community based nursing facilities. Workload based on RAI/MDS can be calculated electronically by the interactions of the elements of the MDS data and grouped into 53 categories referred to as Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV). Residents are assessed quarterly. The data is grouped for analysis at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). Conversion to electronic data entry and transmission to the AITC was completed system-wide by year-end 2000. In 2010, the Centeres for Medicare and Medicaide Services released a significantly upgraded version, MDS 3.0, to begin to be implemented on October 1, 2011 in VHA CLCs.

Water samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties, major inorganic ions, selected trace elements, and dissolved organic carbon. Selected trace elements included antimony, arsenic, cadmium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, and zinc. Stream bed-sediment and soil samples were analyzed for major inorganic ions, selected trace elements, and grain size distribution.Surface-water samples were collected near the downstream transect of each stream reach. Monitoring wells were located adjacent to the stream reach and in close proximity to the surface-water sampling sites. Bulk bed-sediment samples were collected during normal low-flow conditions. Each sample consisted of a composite sample from five locations (right edge, left edge, and center of a middle transect, then upstream and downstream of the middle transect) within each stream reach. Three soil samples, one from hilltops, one from side slopes, and one from riparian zones, were collected from areas adjacent to each stream reach.  Each soil sample consisted of 5 to 10 grab samples collected by a 21-inch-long, 5/8-inch internal diameter stainless-steel hand auger and composited in Teflon lined pans.

The outer limit of each of these zones is measured from the U.S. normal baseline, which coincides with the low water line depicted on NOAA charts and includes closing lines across the entrances of legal bays and rivers, consistent with international law. The U.S. baseline and associated maritime limits are reviewed and approved through the interagency U.S. Baseline Committee, which is chaired by the U.S. Department of State.  The Committee serves the function of gaining interagency consensus on the proper location of the baseline using the provisions of the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, to ensure that the seaward extent of U.S. maritime zones do not exceed the breadth that is permitted by international law.  In 2002 and in response to mounting requests for digital maritime zones, NOAA launched a project to re-evaluate the U.S. baseline in partnership with other federal agencies via the U.S. Baseline Committee.  The focus of the baseline evaluation was NOAA's largest scale, most recent edition nautical charts as well as supplemental source materials for verification of certain charted features.  This dataset is a result of the 2002-present initiative and reflects a multi-year iterative project whereby the baseline and associated maritime limits were re-evaluated on a state or regional basis. In addition to the U.S. maritime limits, the U.S. maritime boundaries with opposite or adjacent countries as well as the US/Canada International Boundary (on land and through the Great Lakes) are also included in this dataset.",

Caution should be taken when making comparisons of percentages calculated using the 2019 and 2020 census estimates since observed difference may result from the shift in the denominator.  The age groups in the state-level data tables will also be changing as a result of the switch to the new denominator.\n\nDPH Provisional State and County Characteristics Estimates April 1, 2020.

Age is based on age at the time of administration of the first dose. \nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received, and data errors are corrected.\nPopulation size estimates are based on 2019 DPH census estimates until 5/26/2022.  From 6/1/2022, 2020 DPH provisional census estimates are used. \nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations.\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.

Some boundary delineations based on the SLA were approximated in this data set, including areas in Hawaii, Alaska, and Washington State. Although state boarders do not extend over water, it was necessary to approximate these borders to produce this data set. \nThe boundaries depicted in this data set are for visual purposes only. The placement of these boundaries was extrapolated from the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Administrative Boundaries as described here http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/05-24659.pdf. The delineation between waters under US sovereign territory jurisdiction and that of federal governance is also approximate.

The EEZ is measured from the US baseline, recognized as the low-water line along the coast as marked on NOAA's nautical charts in accordance with articles of the Laws of the Sea. These limits are ambulatory and subject to revision based on changes in coastline geometry. This dataset was produced based on an update to the Maritime Limits published in September, 2013. \nTo view the most up-to-date Maritime Limits, please see http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/mbound.htm. Navassa Island does not have an EEZ around it, so the seaward extent of the federal waters surrounding it were based on the 12 mile offshore boundary of the USFWS National Wildlife Refuge established on the island.

Risks of injury in traffic collisions are greatest for motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and lowest for bus and rail passengers. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience 4 times the death rate as Whites or Asians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians.

        "description": "Data is collected because of public interest in how the City\u2019s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees. Data is input into the City's Personnel Management System (\u201cPMS\u201d) by the respective user Agencies. Each record represents the following statistics for every city employee: Agency, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Agency Start Date, Work Location Borough, Job Title Description, Leave Status as of the close of the FY (June 30th), Base Salary, Pay Basis, Regular Hours Paid, Regular Gross Paid, Overtime Hours worked, Total Overtime Paid, and Total Other Compensation (i.e. lump sum and/or retro payments). This data can be used to analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime. The reader of this data should be aware that increments of salary increases received over the course of any one fiscal year will not be reflected. All that is captured, is the employee's final base and gross salary at the end of the fiscal year.  In very limited cases, a check replacement and subsequent refund may reflect both the original check as well as the re-issued check in employee pay totals.  \nNOTE 1: To further improve the visibility into the number of employee OT hours worked, beginning with the FY 2023 report, an updated methodology will be used which will eliminate redundant reporting of OT hours in some specific instances.  In the previous calculation, hours associated with both overtime pay as well as an accompanying overtime \u201ccompanion code\u201d pay were included in the employee total even though they represented pay for the same period of time.  With the updated methodology, the dollars shown on the Open Data site will continue to be inclusive of both types of overtime, but the OT hours will now reflect a singular block of time, which will result in a more representative total of employee OT hours worked.   The updated methodology will primarily impact the OT hours associated with City employees in uniformed civil service titles.  The updated methodology will be applied to the Open Data posting for Fiscal Year 2023 and cannot be applied to prior postings and, as a result, the reader of this data should not compare OT hours  prior to the 2023 report against OT hours published starting Fiscal Year 2023.  The reader of this data may continue to compare OT dollars across all published Fiscal Years on Open Data. \nNOTE 2: As a part of FISA-OPA\u2019s routine process for reviewing and releasing Citywide Payroll Data, data for some agencies (specifically NYC Police Department (NYPD) and the District Attorneys\u2019 Offices (Manhattan, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Bronx, and Special Narcotics)) have been redacted since they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law, POL \u00a7 87(2)(f), on the ground that disclosure of the information could endanger the life and safety of the public servants listed thereon. They are further exempt from disclosure pursuant to POL \u00a7 87(2)(e)(iii), on the ground that any release of the information would identify confidential sources or disclose confidential information relating to a criminal investigation, and POL \u00a7 87(2)(e)(iv), on the ground that disclosure would reveal non-routine criminal investigative techniques or procedures.

WWEIA data are collected using USDA's dietary data collection instrument, the Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM). The AMPM is a fully computerized method for collecting 24-hour dietary recalls either in-person or by telephone. \nFor each 2-year data release cycle, the following dietary intake data files are available:\nIndividual Foods File - Contains one record per food for each survey participant. Foods are identified by USDA food codes. Each record contains information about when and where the food was consumed, whether the food was eaten in combination with other foods, amount eaten, and amounts of nutrients provided by the food.\nTotal Nutrient Intakes File - Contains one record per day for each survey participant. Each record contains daily totals of food energy and nutrient intakes, daily intake of water, intake day of week, total number foods reported, and whether intake was usual, much more than usual or much less than usual.

        "description": "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is increasingly dependent upon data.  Most of its employees generate and use vast amounts of data on a daily basis.  To improve our capacity for data analysis while providing the most efficient and the highest quality health care to our Veteran patients, VHA, working with the VA Office of Information and Technology, implemented a health data warehouse.  Central to this plan is consolidating data from disparate sources into a coherent single logical data model.  The Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) is the physical implementation of this logical data model at the enterprise level for VHA.   Although the CDW initially began to store data as early as 2006, a renewed effort began in 2010 to accelerate CDW's content by including more subject areas from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and content from other existing national data systems.  CDW supports fully developed subject areas in its production environment as well as supporting rapid prototyping by extracting data directly from source systems with very minor data transformations.  The Regional Data Warehouses and the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Data Warehouses share content from CDW and allow for greater reporting flexibility at the local level throughout the VHA organization.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.  \nThe boundaries of most incorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2021, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2020 Census.",

        "description": "The East Tehama herd is the largest migratory population of mule deer in California (Hill and Figura, 2020). Population numbers peaked in the 1960s, but have declined in recent decades (Ramsey and others, 1981; California Department of Fish and Wildlife unpublished data). These mule deer migrate from a lower elevation winter range in the foothills east of the Sacramento Valley to upper elevation summer ranges in the southern Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada. Although portions of the herd winter on the California Department of Fish and Wildlife\u2019s Tehama Wildlife Area and other public lands, the winter range also comprises many private ranchlands. The herd\u2019s summer range includes significant portions of Lassen National Forest as well as Lassen Volcanic National Park and private timberlands. Primarily oak woodlands and annual grasslands characterize the winter range, while the summer range consists of conifer forests, montane meadows, and montane chaparral. Potential threats to the herd include habitat changes resulting from fire management (including fire suppression and catastrophic wildfires), forest succession, vegetation management, and climate change. A small percentage of the herd are residents, inhabiting areas along the Sacramento River and areas of irrigated agriculture.These mapping layers show the location of the migration stopovers for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the East Tehama population in California. They were developed from 63 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 33 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 1-23 hours.",

        "description": "A. SUMMARY\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\nC. UPDATE PROCESS\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET\nInterpreting dates in this dataset\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.\nCompanion systems inventory dataset\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online as well.",

RSEI incorporates information from EPA\u2019s TRI database, which tracks certain toxic chemical releases and waste management activities at federal facilities and larger industrial facilities across the United States and its territories. RSEI incorporates over 30 years of TRI data, three U.S. censuses, toxicity and physicochemical properties for more than 400 toxic chemicals, and geographical information for more than 50,000 facilities and thousands of streams and other water bodies. All of this information is used to model and map the environmental fate and transport of each toxic chemical through the environment and the potential impacts that may result. The RSEI model calculates numeric results that are designed to be compared to other RSEI model generated results. These RSEI results are designed to help users contextualize, understand, and better communicate the relative hazards and potential for risks posed by certain waste management activities of TRI chemicals (e.g., from releases to the environment). RSEI results and custom analyses can be used for screening-level activities such as trend analyses that compare potential risk-related impacts from year to year, or for ranking and prioritizing toxic chemicals, facilities, industry sectors, or geographic regions for strategic planning. RSEI can also be used in conjunction with other data sources and environmental information, to help policy makers, researchers, and communities establish priorities for further investigation and to look at changes in potential health impacts over time.",

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2013 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions.

        "description": "The U.S. Hourly Climate Normals for 1981 to 2010 are 30-year averages of meteorological parameters for thousands of U.S. stations located across the 50 states, as well as U.S. territories, commonwealths, the Compact of Free Association nations, and one station inCanada. NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

        "description": "A. SUMMARY \nThis dataset includes data on a variety of substance use services funded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). This dataset only includes Drug MediCal-certified residential treatment, withdrawal management, and methadone treatment. Other private non-Drug Medi-Cal treatment providers may operate in the city. Withdrawal management discharges are inclusive of anyone who left withdrawal management after admission and may include someone who left before completing withdrawal management. \nThis dataset also includes naloxone distribution from the SFDPH Behavioral Health Services Naloxone Clearinghouse and the SFDPH-funded Drug Overdose Prevention and Education program. Both programs distribute naloxone to various community-based organizations who then distribute naloxone to their program participants. Programs may also receive naloxone from other sources. Data from these other sources is not included in this dataset. \nFinally, this dataset includes the number of clients on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). \nThe number of people who were treated with methadone at a Drug Medi-Cal certified Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) by year is populated by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) Behavioral Health Services Quality Management (BHSQM) program. OTPs in San Francisco are required to submit patient billing data in an electronic medical record system called Avatar. BHSQM calculates the number of people who received methadone annually based on Avatar data. Data only from Drug MediCal certified OTPs were included in this dataset. \nThe number of people who receive buprenorphine by year is populated from the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), administered by the California Department of Justice. All licensed prescribers in California are required to document controlled substance prescriptions in CURES. The Center on Substance Use and Health calculates the total number of people who received a buprenorphine prescription annually based on CURES data. Formulations of buprenorphine that are prescribed only for pain management are excluded.  \nPeople may receive buprenorphine and methadone in the same year, so you cannot add the Buprenorphine Clients by Year, and Methadone Clients by Year data together to get the total number of unique people receiving medications for opioid use disorder. \nFor more information on where to find treatment in San Francisco, visit findtreatment-sf.org.\u202f \nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED \nThis dataset is created by copying the data into this dataset from the SFDPH Behavioral Health Services Quality Management Program, the California Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), and the Office of Overdose Prevention. \nC. UPDATE PROCESS \nResidential Substance Use Treatment, Withdrawal Management, Methadone, and Naloxone data are updated quarterly with a 45-day delay. Buprenorphine data are updated quarterly and when the state makes this data available, usually at a 5-month delay. \nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET \nThroughout the year this dataset may include partial year data for methadone and buprenorphine treatment. As both methadone and buprenorphine are used as long-term treatments for opioid use disorder, many people on treatment at the end of one calendar year will continue into the next. For this reason, doubling (methadone), or quadrupling (buprenorphine) partial year data will not accurately project year-end totals.  \nE. RELATED DATASETS \nOverdose-Related 911 Responses by Emergency Medical Services \nUnintentional Overdose Death Rates by Race/Ethnicity \nPreliminary Unintentional Drug Overdose Deaths",

This is a national county-level database of cancer data that are collected by state\npublic health surveillance systems. All-site cancer is defined as any type of cancer that is\ncaptured in the state registry data, though non-melanoma skin cancer is not included. All-site\nage-adjusted cancer incidence rates were abstracted separately for males and females.\nCounty-level annual age-adjusted all-site cancer incidence rates for years 2006\u20132010 were\navailable for 2687 of 3142 (85.5%) counties in the U.S. Counties for which there are fewer\nthan 16 reported cases in a specific area-sex-race category are suppressed to ensure\nconfidentiality and stability of rate estimates; this accounted for 14 counties in our study.\nTwo states, Kansas and Virginia, do not provide data because of state legislation and\nregulations which prohibit the release of county level data to outside entities. Data from\nMichigan does not include cases diagnosed in other states because data exchange\nagreements prohibit the release of data to third parties. Finally, state data is not available for\nthree states, Minnesota, Ohio, and Washington. The age-adjusted average annual\nincidence rate for all counties was 453.7 per 100,000 persons.\nWe selected 2006\u20132010 as it is subsequent in time to the EQI exposure data which was\nconstructed to represent the years 2000\u20132005. We also gathered data for the three leading\ncauses of cancer for males (lung, prostate, and colorectal) and females (lung, breast, and\ncolorectal). \nThe EQI was used as an exposure metric as an indicator of cumulative environmental\nexposures at the county-level representing the period 2000 to 2005. A complete description\nof the datasets used in the EQI are provided in Lobdell et al.  and methods used for index\nconstruction are described by Messer et al. The EQI was developed for the period 2000\u2013\n2005 because it was the time period for which the most recent data were available when\nindex construction was initiated. The EQI includes variables representing each of the\nenvironmental domains. The air domain includes 87 variables representing criteria and\nhazardous air pollutants. The water domain includes 80 variables representing overall water\nquality, general water contamination, recreational water quality, drinking water quality,\natmospheric deposition, drought, and chemical contamination. The land domain includes 26\nvariables representing agriculture, pesticides, contaminants, facilities, and radon. The built\ndomain includes 14 variables representing roads, highway/road safety, public transit\nbehavior, business environment, and subsidized housing environment. The\nsociodemographic environment includes 12 variables representing socioeconomics and\ncrime.

        "description": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf \nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

SUMMARY\nLaw Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service \u2013 Real-time dataset includes all calls for service  which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (\u2018On-View\u2019).  \nThe Real-time dataset is delayed by 10 minutes, and represents a rolling 48 hour window of calls for service.  It contains both open and closed calls and is updated every 10 minutes.  It is delayed by 10 minutes. Open calls are active calls that are unverified, but being worked by law enforcement. Closed calls are calls that law enforcement have indicated are resolved.  Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. The dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and others. All relevant time intervals are also included. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. \nPlease refer Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer for full documentation \nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED\nOnce a received 911 call is dispatched, a record (CAD#) is generated in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System.   \nC. UPDATE PROCESS \nUpdated every 10 minutes with the past 48hrs of open and closed calls that have been dispatched. \nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET \nPlease refer Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer for full documentation \nE.

The index, which is seasonally adjusted, combines available data on freight traffic, as well as passenger travel, that have been weighted to yield a monthly measure of transportation services output.\nFor charts and discussion on the relationship of the TSI to the economy, see our Transportation as an Economic Indicator: Transportation Services Index page  (https://data.bts.gov/stories/s/TET-indicator-1/9czv-tjte)\nFor release schedule see: https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/transportation-services-index-release-schedule\nAbout seasonally-adjusted data\nStatisticians use the process of seasonal-adjustment to uncover trends in data. Monthly data, for instance, are influenced by the number of days and the number of weekends in a month as well as by the timing of holidays and seasonal activity. These influences make it difficult to see underlying changes in the data. Statisticians use seasonal adjustment to control for these influences.\nControlling of seasonal influences allows measurement of real monthly changes; short and long term patterns of growth or decline; and turning points. Data for one month can be compared to data for any other month in the series and the data series can be ranked to find high and low points. Any observed differences are \u201creal\u201d differences; that is, they are differences brought about by changes in the data and not brought about by a change in the number of days or weekends in the month, the occurrence or non-occurrence of a holiday, or seasonal activity.",

Members of the public interested in the identity of a specific incident may contact ACRC directly to inquire about the incident and, if it is closed, ACRC will release a copy of the file to the person requesting it. However, location data regarding where the incident was reported or occurred is included within this data set, which may or may not be the same location as the animal owner's home or property.\nIn addition, to protect the identity of the complainant (person filing the complaint or alerting ACRC to a potential incident), only the complainant's street name is included as part of this data set. \nFinally, while all incidents are updated on a daily basis, incidents involving animal cruelty are updated based on a rolling 30-day delay to allow for ACRC to investigate the incident and make a determination as to the validity of the cruelty complaint.",

Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/). Relevant directives include: \n\u2022   Special Order S06-01-11 \u2013 CLEAR Automated Arrest System: describes the application used by Department members to enter arrest data. \n\u2022   Special Order S06-01-04 \u2013 Arrestee Identification Process: describes processes related to obtaining and using CB numbers. \n\u2022   Special Order S09-03-04 \u2013 Assignment and Processing of Records Division Numbers: describes processes related to obtaining and using RD numbers. \n\u2022   Special Order 06-01 \u2013 Processing Persons Under Department Control: describes required tasks associated with arrestee processing, include the requirement that Department members order charges based on severity.",

A set of training examples---examples with known output values---is used by a learning algorithm to generate a model. This model is intended to approximate the mapping between the inputs and outputs. This model can be used to generate predicted outputs for inputs that have not been seen before. Within supervised learning, one type of task is a classification learning task, in which each output consists of one or more classes to which the corresponding input belongs. For example, we may have data consisting of observations of sunspots.  In a classification learning task, our goal may be to learn to classify sunspots into one of several types.  Each example may correspond to one candidate sunspot with various measurements or just an image.  A learning algorithm would use the supplied examples to generate a model that approximates the mapping between each supplied set of measurements and the type of sunspot.  This model can then be used to classify previously unseen sunspots based on the candidate's measurements. In this chapter, we explain several basic classification algorithms.",

The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists. \nThe ZCTA boundaries in this release are those delineated following the 2010 Census.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violence-reduction-victim-demographics-aggregated",
        "description": "This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January \u2013 March, April \u2013 June, July \u2013 September, October \u2013 December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.\nThis dataset includes a \" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table. \nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset",

        "description": "Climate change threatens coral reefs through multiple pathways and interactions with local stressors. More resilient reefs have a higher likelihood of returning to a coral-dominated state following disturbance. To advance practical approaches to reef resilience assessments and aid resilience-based management of coral reefs, we conducted a resilience assessment for Puerto Rico\u2019s coral reefs modified from methods used in other U.S. jurisdictions. We calculated relative resilience scores for 103 sites from an existing commonwealth-wide survey using eight resilience indicators and identified which indicators most drove resilience. We found that sites of very different relative resilience were generally highly intermixed, underscoring the importance and necessity of decision making and management at fine scales. In combination with information on levels of two localized stressors (fishing pressure and pollution exposure), we used the resilience indicators to assess which of seven potential management actions could be used at each site to maintain or improve resilience. Fishery management was the management action that applied to the most sites. Furthermore, we combined sites\u2019 resilience scores with ocean warming predictions to assign sites to vulnerability categories. Island-wide or local managers can use the actions and vulnerability information as a starting point for resilience-based management of their reefs. This assessment differs from many previous ones because we tested how much information could be yielded by a \u201cdesktop\u201d assessment using freely-available, existing data rather than from a customized, resilience-focused field\nsurvey. The available data still permitted analyses comparable to previous assessments, demonstrating that desktop resilience assessments can substitute for assessments with field components under some circumstances. \nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGibbs, D., and J.

The study assessed\n familial and nonfamilial types of violence. It was designed as a\n telephone survey of American youth aged 12-17 living in United States\n households and residing with a parent or guardian. One parent or\n guardian in each household was interviewed briefly to establish\n rapport, secure permission to interview the targeted adolescent, and\n to ensure the collection of comparative data to examine potential\n nonresponse bias from households without adolescent participation.\n All interviews with both parents and adolescents were conducted using\n Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) technology. From the\n surveys of parents and adolescents, the principal investigators\n created one data file by attaching the data from the parents to the\n records of their respective adolescents. Adolescents were asked\n whether violence and drug abuse were problems in their schools and\n communities and what types of violence they had personally\n witnessed. They were also asked about other stressful events in their\n lives, such as the loss of a family member, divorce, unemployment,\n moving to a new home or school, serious illness or injury, and natural\n disaster. Questions regarding history of sexual assault, physical\n assault, and harsh physical discipline elicited a description of the\n event and perpetrator, extent of injuries, age at abuse, whether\n alcohol or drugs were involved, and who was informed of the\n incident. Information was also gathered on the delinquent behavior of\n respondents and their friends, including destruction of property,\n assault, theft, sexual assault, and gang activity. Other questions\n covered history of personal and family substance use and mental health\n indicators, such as major depression, post-traumatic stress disorders,\n weight changes, sleeping disorders, and problems\n concentrating. Demographic information was gathered from the\n adolescents on age, race, gender, number of people living in\n household, and grade in school. Parents were asked whether they were\n concerned about violent crime, affordable child care, drug abuse,\n educational quality, gangs, and the safety of their children at\n school. In addition, they were questioned about their own\n victimization experiences and whether they discussed personal safety\n issues with their children.

The percent was calculated using data from four metropolitan planning organizations (San Diego Association of Governments, Southern California Association of Governments, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Sacramento Council of Governments) and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. A strong and sustainable transportation system supports safe, reliable, and affordable transportation opportunities for walking, bicycling, and public transit, and helps reduce health inequities by providing more opportunities for access to healthy food, jobs, health care, education, and other essential services. Active and public transportation promote health by enabling individuals to increase their level of physical activity, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease and obesity, improving mental health, and lowering blood pressure.

Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts.\nSeveral data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts. Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Provisional data presented will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.\nFor more information please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm",

To monitor and map these changes, a 26 general LULC class system was used. The classification system that was developed was primarily inspired by the \u201cYangambi Classification\u201d (Trochain, 1957). This fairly broad class system for LULC was used because the classes can be readily identified on Landsat satellite imagery. A visual photo-interpretation approach was used to identify and map the LULC classes represented on Landsat images. The Rapid Land Cover Mapper (RLCM) was used to facilitate the photo-interpretation using Esri\u2019s ArcGIS Desktop ArcMap software.

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ionosonde-stations",
        "description": "Ionograms are recorded tracings of reflected high frequency radio pulses generated by an ionosonde. Unique relationships exist between the sounding frequency and the ionization densities which can reflect it. As the sounder sweeps from lower to higher frequencies, the signal rises above the noise of commercial radio sources and records the return signal reflected from the different layers of the ionosphere. These echoes form characteristic patterns of\n                    \"traces\" that comprise the ionogram. Radio pulses travel more slowly within the ionosphere than in free space, therefore, the apparent or \"virtual\" height is recorded instead of a true height. For frequencies approaching the level of maximum plasma frequency in a layer, the virtual height tends to infinity, because the pulse must travel a finite distance at effectively zero speed. The frequencies at which this occurs are called the critical frequencies. Characteristic values\n                    of virtual heights (designated as h'E, h'F, and h'F2, etc.) and critical frequencies (designated as foE, foF1, and foF2, etc.) of each layer are scaled, manually or by computer, from these ionograms. Typically, an ionosonde station obtains one ionogram recording every 15 minutes. When the scaling is done manually only the hourly recordings are routinely reduced to numerical data. Modern ionosondes with computer-driven automatic scaling procedures routinely scale all the\n                    ionograms recorded. The resulting numerical values, along with the original ionograms and station reports, are archived at five World Data Centers (WDCs) for Ionosphere. The ionosphere is divided into four broad regions called D,E, F, and topside. These regions may be further divided into several regularly occurring layers, such as F1 or F2.D Region: The region between about 75 and 95km above the Earth in which the relatively weak) ionization is mainly responsible for\n                    absorption of high-frequency radio waves. E Region: The region between about 95 and 150km above the Earth that marks the height of the regular daytime E layer. Other subdivisions isolating separate layers of irregular occurrence within this region are also labeled with an E prefix, such as the thick layer, E2, and a highly variable thin layer, Sporadic E. Ions in this region are mainly O2+. F Region: The region above about 150km in which the important reflecting layer, F2, is\n                    found. Other layers within this region are also described using the prefix F, such as a temperate-latitude regular stratification, F1, and a low-latitude, semi-regular stratification, F1.5. Ions in the lower part of the F layer are mainly NO+ and are predominantly O+ in the upper part. The F layer is the region of primary interest for radio communications.",

        "description": "Investigator(s): Federal Bureau of Investigation\nSince 1930, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has compiled the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) to serve as periodic nationwide assessments of reported crimes not available elsewhere in the criminal justice system. With the 1977 data, the title was expanded to Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data. Each year, participating law enforcement agencies contribute reports to the FBI either directly or through their state reporting programs. ICPSR archives the UCR data as five separate components: (1) summary data, (2) county-level data, (3) incident-level data (National Incident-Based Reporting System [NIBRS]), (4) hate crime data, and (5) various, mostly nonrecurring, data collections. Summary data are reported in four types of files: (a) Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest, (b) Property Stolen and Recovered, (c) Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), and (d) Police Employee (LEOKA) Data (Law Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted). The county-level data provide counts of arrests and offenses aggregated to the county level. County populations are also reported. In the late 1970s, new ways to look at crime were studied. The UCR program was subsequently expanded to capture incident-level data with the implementation of the National Incident-Based Reporting System. The NIBRS data focus on various aspects of a crime incident. The gathering of hate crime data by the UCR program was begun in 1990. Hate crimes are defined as crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. In September 1994, disabilities, both physical and mental, were added to the list. The fifth component of ICPSR's UCR holdings is comprised of various collections, many of which are nonrecurring and prepared by individual researchers. These collections go beyond the scope of the standard UCR collections provided by the FBI, either by including data for a range of years or by focusing on other aspects of analysis.\nNACJD has produced resource guides on UCR and on\u00a0NIBRS\u00a0data.",

The predominant mode \u2013 the automobile - offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Automobile commuting has been linked to stress-related health problems. Active modes of transport \u2013 bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit \u2013 offer opportunities for physical activity, which is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression. Risk of injury and death in collisions are higher in urban areas with more concentrated vehicle and pedestrian activity.  Bus and rail passengers have a lower risk of injury in collisions than motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience four times the death rate Whites or Asian pedestrians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians.

TIGERweb consists of a web mapping service and a REST service.\n      Thew web mapping service is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) service that allows users to visualize our TIGER\n      (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing database) data. This service consists of two\n      applications and eight services. The applications allow users to select features and view their attributes, to search\n      for features by name or geocode, and to identify features by selecting them from a map. The TIGERweb applications are a\n      simple way to view our TIGER data without having to download the data. The web Mapping services provide a simple HTTP\n      interface for requesting geo-registered map images from our geospatial database. It allows users to\n      produce maps containing TIGERweb layers with layers from other servers. TIGERweb consists of\n      the following two applications and eight  services: \n      Applications: TIGERweb,  TIGERweb Decennial\n      Services: Current,  ACS16, ACS15, ACS14, ACS13, Econ12, Census 2010 (for the TIGERweb application), Physical Features (for the TIGERweb application),\n      Census 2010 (for the TIGERweb Decennial application), Census 2000 and Physical Features (for the TIGERweb Decennial application)\n\n      The REST service is a way for Web clients to communicate with geographic information system (GIS) servers through Representational\n      State Transfer (REST) technology.

        "description": "In Pittsburgh, Autonomous Vehicle (AV) companies have been testing autonomous vehicles since September 2016. However, the tech is new, and there have been some high-profile behavior that we believe warrants a larger conversation. So in early 2017, we set out to design a survey to see both how BikePGH donor-members, and Pittsburgh residents at large, feel about about sharing the road with AVs as a bicyclist and/or as a pedestrian. Our survey asked participants how they feel about being a fellow road user with AVs, either walking or biking. We also wanted to collect stories about people\u2019s experiences interacting with this nascent technology. We are unaware of any public surveys about people\u2019s feelings or understanding of this new technology.\nWe hope that our results will help add to the body of data and help the public and politicians understand the complexity of possible futures that different economic models AV technology can bring to our cities and towncenters.\nWe conducted our 2017 survey in two parts. First, we launched the survey exclusively to donor-members, yielding 321 responses (out of 2,900) via email. Once we closed the survey, we launched it again, but allowed the general public to take it. Through promoting it on our website, social media channels, and a few news articles, we yielded 798 responses (mostly from people in the Pittsburgh region), for a combined total of 1,119 responses.\nRegarding the 2019 survey: In total, 795 people responded. BikePGH solicited responses from their blog, website, and email list. There were also a few local news articles about the survey. While many questions were kept similar to the 2017 survey, BikePGH wanted to dig a bit deeper into regulations as well as demographics this time around.\nThe 2019 follow up survey also aims to see how the landscape has changed, and how specifically, Pittsburghers on bike and on foot feel about sharing the road with AVs so that we\u2019re all better prepared to deal with this new reality and help make sure that it is introduced as safely as humanly possible.",

        "description": "The VA National Clozapine Registry tracks the health and demographics of patients who have been prescribed clozapine by the VA. Clozapine, or the brand name Clozaril, is a drug used to treat the most serious cases of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, clozapine may also affect portions of the blood, lowering the body's resistance to infection and sometimes creating life-threatening circumstances. Realizing the severity of the problem, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established guidelines for analysis of White Blood Cells and Neutrophils and set strict minimum limits. The FDA also mandated that any manufacturer of clozapine must maintain a Clozapine Registry. These registries are to track the location and the health of clozapine patients and to ensure 'weekly White Blood Cell testing prior to delivery of the next week's supply of medication'. To date, the clozapine manufacturer registries have been unable to develop sufficient controls to meet these requirements, especially the ability to prevent dispensing clozapine when blood results are abnormal. However, because of the unique structure of Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, the Veterans Health Administration obtained permission from the FDA and clozapine manufacturers to use its in-place computer network to gather and evaluate weekly patient information, then export this data to manufacturer clozapine registries. The VA assigned functional administration of this effort to the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) located in Dallas, Texas. Weekly data on each VA clozapine patient is processed at two locations. Facility Level --When a clozapine prescription is written, a computer program in each facility's internal computer system retrieves white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and clozapine dose and evaluates the information according to FDA guidelines. If an adverse blood condition is found, the computer may warn to trigger a physician reevaluation, or lock out entirely to prevent dispensing, depending on the severity. Weekly, this information, along with certain patient demographic information, is gathered locally and transmitted to Hines Office of Information & Technology Field Office for centralized storage. This data can only be accessed by the NCCC. Raw data is downloaded from the Hines OI Field Office database on a weekly basis. An ancillary computer program reformats the data and evaluates the information for inconsistencies and data gathering errors. The computer-corrected data is manually compared with hand-written facsimile information sent to the NCCC by each site. This manually corrected data is again reformatted for data storage in MS Access format at the NCCC. The corrected data is also reformatted into American Standard Code for Information Interchange fixed-length fields and transmitted via modem to the manufacturers' Clozapine Registry and, in turn, to the FDA.",

        "description": "CAL_LID_L3_Tropospheric_APro_AllSky-Standard-V4-20 is the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Lidar Level 3 Tropospheric Aerosol Profiles, All Sky Data, Standard Version 4-20 data product. This data product was collected using the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument. Data collection for this product is ongoing.\nThe CALIPSO lidar level 3 aerosol data product reports monthly mean profiles of aerosol optical properties on a uniform spatial grid. It is intended to be a tropospheric product and so data are only reported below altitudes of 12 km. All level 3 parameters are derived from the version 4.20 CALIOP level 2 aerosol profile product and have been quality screened prior to averaging. The primary quantities reported are vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficient at 532 nm and its vertical integral, the aerosol optical depth (AOD). Aerosol type and spatial distribution information are also included. Averaged profile data is reported for all aerosols, regardless of type, and for mineral dust aerosol only. Classification of dust is based on the aerosol type flags in the level 2 profile product. To keep level 3 file sizes manageable, there are four different types of level 3 files produced, depending on the sky condition and the temporal coverage of the data prior to averaging.\nDescription of the Four Sky Conditions (Day, Night):\n1) All Sky: All level 2 columns are averaged, regardless of cloud occurrence,\n2) Cloud-Free: Only cloud-free level 2 columns are averaged,\n3) Cloudy-Sky, Transparent: Only level 2 columns containing transparent clouds are averaged, and\n4) Cloud-Sky, Opaque: Only level 2 columns containing opaque clouds are averaged\nCALIPSO was launched on April 28, 2006 and continues to collect data necessary to study the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and climate . It flies in the international A-Train constellation for coincident Earth observations. The CALIPSO satellite comprises three instruments, CALIOP, Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR), and Wide Field Camera (WFC). CALIPSO is a joint satellite mission between NASA and the French Agency, CNES.",

        "description": "MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands),and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at various DAACs and has been made available to public since April 2000.\nThe shortname for this level-3 MODIS aerosol product is MCDAODHD. The Naval Research Laboratory and the University of North Dakota developed this value-added aerosol optical depth dataset based on MODIS Level 2 aerosol products. MCDAODHD is a gridded product and is specifically designed for quantitative applications including data assimilation and model validation. It is available through LANCE-MODIS. It offers several enhancements over the MODIS Level 2 data on which it is based. These enhancements include stringent filtering to reduce outliers, eliminate cloud contamination, and exclude conditions where aerosol detection is likely to be inaccurate; reduction of systematic biases over land and ocean by empirical corrections; reduction of random variation in AOD values by spatial averaging; quantitative estimation of uncertainty for each AOD data point.\nThe MxDAODHD granules are produced every six hours, and time-stamped 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 (all times UTC). Each granule includes MODIS observations from +/-3 hours from the timestamp (e.g. 12:00 product includes MODIS data from 09:00-15:00 UTC). Production is initiated as soon as the Level 2 inputs become available in the LANCE system.\nSee the LANCE-MODIS page for more dataset information: \nhttps://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt",

The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.\nNHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.\nThe NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).\nWhile the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.",

Glenn Research Center management is reviewing the availability requirements for these software packages. We are working with Center management to get the review completed and issues resolved in a timely manner. We will post updates on this website when the issues are resolved. We apologize for any inconvenience. Please contact Jonathan Litt, jonathan.s.litt@nasa.gov, if you have any questions in the meantime.\nSubject Area:\n    Engine Health\nDescription:\n    This data set was generated with the C-MAPSS simulator. C-MAPSS stands for 'Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation' and it is a tool for the simulation of realistic large commercial turbofan engine data. Each flight is a combination of a series of flight conditions with a reasonable linear transition period to allow the engine to change from one flight condition to the next. The flight conditions are arranged to cover a typical ascent from sea level to 35K ft and descent back down to sea level. The fault was injected at a given time in one of the flights and persists throughout the remaining flights, effectively increasing the age of the engine. The intent is to identify which flight and when in the flight the fault occurred.\nHow Data Was Acquired:\n    The data provided is from a high fidelity system level engine simulation designed to simulate nominal and fault engine degradation over a series of flights. The simulated data was created with a Matlab Simulink tool called C-MAPSS.\nSample Rates and Parameter Description:\n    The flights are full flight recordings sampled at 1 Hz and consist of 30 engine and flight condition parameters. Each flight contains 7 unique flight conditions for an approximately 90 min flight including ascent to cruise at 35K ft and descent back to sea level. The parameters for each flight are the flight conditions, health indicators, measurement temperatures and pressure measurements.\nFaults/Anomalies:\n    Faults arose from the inlet engine fan, the low pressure compressor, the high pressure compressor, the high pressure turbine and the low pressure turbine.",

The DMSP program maintains a constellation of sun-synchronous, near-polar orbiting satellites. The orbital period is 101 minutes and inclination is 99 degrees. The atmospheric and oceanographic sensors record radiances at visible, infrared and microwave wavelengths. The solar geophysical sensors measure ionospheric plasma fluxes, densities, temperatures and velocities. DMSP visible and infrared imagery of clouds covers a 3,000 km swath, thus each satellite provides global coverage of both day night time conditions each day. The field view of the microwave imagers and sounders is only 1,500 km thus approximately 3 days data are required for one instrument to provide global coverage at equatorial latitudes. The solar geophysical instruments make in-situ measurements of ionospheric parameters, some of which vary very rapidly. The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) receive the complete DMSP data stream from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Offutt Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska. Data are currently transmitted in near realtime from AFWA directly to the archive via a designated T1 line. Archive processing prepares orbital data sets of calibrated, quality assessed data organized as a time-series, restores data lost during transmission,and accurately computes satellite positions. NCEI maintains an archive of all data recorded on DMSP satellites as relayed to The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) by the Air Force Weather Agency. Data from March 1992 to March 1994, are considered to be experimental. After March 1994, the system was fully operational.

The WIMS database resulted from implementation of the Water Well Drillers Law of 1985. The information about well location, well ownership, well completion date, well construction, well yield, static water level, and borehole stratigraphy was provided by well drillers as required by state statute RSMo 256.600-256.640. Wells drilled prior to July of 1987 are not included in this data set. A WIMS Well Search is also available online at http://dnr.mo.gov/mowells/publicLanding.do\nThese data were formally named MO_2015_Wells_shp.zip which have been removed from MSDIS at MO Office of Administration request.",

The growth rate of 42.9% in Asian Americans between 2000 and 2010 is phenomenal given that the corresponding figure for the U.S. total population is only 9.3% (see Figure 1). Currently, Asian Americans make up 5.6% of the total U.S. population and are projected to reach 10% by 2050. It is particularly notable that Asians have recently overtaken Hispanics as the largest group of new immigrants to the U.S. (Pew Research Center, 2015).

        "description": "A. SUMMARY \nThis dataset comes from the San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency and includes all overdose-related 911 calls responded to by emergency medical services (ambulances). The purpose of this dataset is to show how many overdose-related 911 calls the San Francisco Fire Department and other ambulance companies respond to each week. This dataset is based on ambulance patient care records and not 911 calls for service data. \nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED \nThe San Francisco Fire Department and other ambulance companies send electronic patient care reports to the California Emergency Medical Services Agency for all 911 calls they respond to. The San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency (SF EMSA) has access to the state database that includes all reports for 911 calls in San Francisco County. In order to identify overdose-related calls that resulted in an emergency medical service (or ambulance) response, SF EMSA filters the patient care reports based on set criteria used in other jurisdictions called The Rhode Island Criteria. These criteria filter calls to only include those calls where EMS documented that an overdose was involved and/or naloxone (Narcan) was administered. Calls that do not involve an overdose are filtered out of the dataset. Calls that result in a patient death on scene are also filtered out of the dataset. \nThis dataset is created by copying the total number of calls each week when the state makes this data available. \nC. UPDATE PROCESS \nData is generally available with a 24-hour lag on a weekly frequency but the exact lag and update frequency is based on when the State makes this data available.  \nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET \nThis dataset includes the total number of calls a week. The week starts on a Sunday and ends on the following Saturday. \nThis dataset will not match the Fire Department Calls for Service dataset, as this dataset has been filtered to include only overdose-related 911 calls based on electronic patient care report data. Additionally, the Fire Department Calls for Service data are primarily based on 911 call data (i.e. calls triaged and recorded by San Francisco\u2019s 911 call center) and not the finalized electronic patient care reports recorded by Fire Department paramedics. \nE. RELATED DATASETS \nFire Department Calls for Service \n San Francisco Department of Public Health Substance Use Services \nUnintentional Overdose Death Rates by Race/Ethnicity \nPreliminary Unintentional Drug Overdose Deaths",

REFPROP is based on the most accurate pure fluid and mixture models currently available. It implements three models for the thermodynamic properties of pure fluids: equations of state explicit in Helmholtz energy, the modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state, and an extended corresponding states (ECS) model. Mixture calculations employ a model that applies mixing rules to the Helmholtz energy of the mixture components; it uses a departure function to account for the departure from ideal mixing. Viscosity and thermal conductivity are modeled with either fluid-specific correlations, an ECS method, or in some cases the friction theory method.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n            The TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\n\n            The boundaries of most incorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2019, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-person",
        "description": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions person table contains details for people involved in the crash. Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.\nThe Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department\u2019s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

There are no systematic differences between the old  and new minor versions. The fitting areas are a slightly  different for some sites, but the resulting differences in the data are within the known uncertainties ranges. A major update to the catalogue is aniticipated in the summer of 2019.\nThe emissions  estimates are based on the fitting of the operational Aura/OMI planetary boundary layer (PBL) SO2 data produced with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm (10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022) and a site-specific AMF adjustment  for each site (Fioletov et al., 2016). The emission estimate method for linking OMI level 2 SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) to emissions is based on a fit of OMI VCDs to an empirical plume model developed to describe the SO2 spatial distribution (as seen by OMI) near emissions point sources. The plume model assumes that the SO2 concentrations emitted from a point source decline exponentially along wind direction and are affected by turbulent diffusion that can be described by a 2D Gaussian function. The average  SO2 mass is derived from the fit and the emission rate is calculated as the ratio between the total mass and the prescribed SO2 lifetime.",

The inventory provides a single resource for information about all known completed and in-progress broad-area public domain elevation data. The information provided for each elevation dataset includes many attributes such as vertical accuracy, point spacing, and date of collection. A direct link to access the data or information about the contact organization is also available through the inventory. \nThe United States Interagency Elevation Inventory raises awareness of and increases access to existing elevation data, thereby reducing data duplication efforts. It helps to identify data gaps and informs and encourages collaboration on future data collection efforts. The inventory displays data set boundaries and provides information about the elevation data but does not host the data itself. If available, links to access the data, metadata, and reports are included.\nThe inventory viewer uses map services from multiple sources to provide information both topography and bathymetry. Map services from NOAA NCEI display the footprints and attribute information for the NOAA Hydrographic Surveys, Multibeam Bathymetry, and Trackline Surveys. A map service from USACE provides the USACE Hydrographic Surveys. Map services from NOAA Office for Coastal Management provide the bulk of the topographic and bathymetric lidar information. The NOAA NCEI and USACE service are updated regularly as new data in ingested.\nThe data supporting the NOAA OCM hosted services are maintained by a partnership of federal agencies and supports the federal elevation theme. The agencies include NOAA, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

        "description": "This data includes filings related to mortgage foreclosure in Allegheny County. The foreclosure process enables a lender to take possession of a property due to an owner's failure to make mortgage payments.  Mortgage foreclosure differs from tax foreclosure, which is a process enabling local governments to take possession of a property if the owner fails to pay property taxes.\nAs Pennsylvania is a judicial foreclosure state, a lender files for foreclosure through the court system.  Foreclosure data in the court system is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Court Records. Data included here is from the general docket, and a  mortgage foreclosure docket created to help homeowners maintain ownership of their property following an initial filing. Several different types of legal filings may occur on a property involved in the foreclosure process. At this time, only the most recent filing in a case is included in the data found here, but we hope to add all filings for a case in the coming months.\nAfter a property enters the foreclosure process, several potential outcomes are possible. Some of the more common outcomes include:  borrowers may come to an agreement with the lender for unpaid debt; borrowers may sell the property to satisfy part or all of the debt; borrowers may voluntarily relinquish ownership to the lender; lenders may decide not to pursue the foreclosure any further; and the property may proceed all the way through a sheriff sale, where it is sold to a new owner.\nBefore September 2022, the data presented here included only the final filing for the month in which each case (represented by Case ID) is opened; since then the feed has changed so we now have a new last_activity field, which gets updated whenever there is a new filing in the case with the date of the last filing for the month. The last_activity value gives some indication of which cases are still ongoing. (However, the new feed does not include the docket_type field, so these are blank for cases started after August 2022.) To view the detailed mortgage foreclosure filings for each property represented in this dataset, please visit the Department of Court Records Website, and enter the Case ID for a property to pull-up detailed information about each foreclosure case, including parties, docket entries, and services.\nChangelog\n2022-12-14: Loaded data back to September (which had been missing due to the schema migration). Added a new last_activity field. Data since September 2022 is missing the docket_type value, for now those new values will be set to '' (empty string).\nVisualizations",

        "description": "This data release provides descriptions of more than 60 mineral regions, mines, and mineral deposits within the United States and its territories that are reported to contain enrichments of cobalt (Co). To focus the scope of this data release, we report only mined deposits and exploration prospects with past production, or resource and reserve estimates of 1,000 metric tons or more of cobalt. Cobalt has diverse uses because of its properties, which include ferromagnetism, hardness, wear-resistance, low conductivity, and high melting point. The primary uses for cobalt are in rechargeable battery electrodes, and in superalloys used to make gas turbine engines. In 2017, the United States had a net import reliance as a percentage of apparent consumption of 72 percent for cobalt, and cobalt is considered a critical mineral. Cobalt mineralogy is diverse; it occurs in a variety of sulfide, arsenide, sulfarsenide, and oxyhydroxide minerals. In the United States, cobalt could be derived as a byproduct from mineral deposits that primarily produce other metals, including nickel, copper, zinc, and lead. The inclusion of a particular mineral deposit or prospect in this database is not meant to imply that it has economic potential. Rather, these entries were included to capture the characteristics of the deposits and prospects in the United States and its territories that have the largest cobalt resources. These deposits and prospects occur in Alaska, California, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico and Tennessee. Several deposits and prospects were not included in this database, because they contain less than 1,000 metric tons of cobalt. A prime example is the Bunkerville project in Nevada (Ludington and others, 2006).  The Stillwater deposit in Montana produced cobalt, but this was a byproduct, and to our knowledge, there are no published records of the amount of cobalt produced, or the amount of cobalt contained within the deposit. Analyses of rock chips from 47 outcrops of the Katahdin deposit in Maine indicates that the deposit locally contains approximately 0.1 percent cobalt (Miller, 1945), but a thorough analysis of the deposit is lacking.  Mine La Motte in Missouri and the Stone Corral project in California were not included because of a lack of ore reserve information in publicly available references. However, we are aware that cobalt is present in the area and we welcome further information on these sites.The entries and descriptions in the database were derived from published papers, reports, data, and internet documents, published from 1908 to 2018, representing a variety of sources, including geologic and exploration studies described in State, Federal, and industry reports. Although an attempt was made to capture as many examples as possible, this dataset is a progress report that is part of an ongoing effort. The authors welcome additional published information in order to continually update and refine this dataset.",

These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.\nThe generalized ZCTA boundaries in this file are based on those delineated following the 2010 Census.",

Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the COVID-19 update.\nThe following data show the number of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths per 100,000 population by race and ethnicity. Crude rates represent the total cases or deaths per 100,000 people. Age-adjusted rates consider the age of the person at diagnosis or death when estimating the rate and use a standardized population to provide a fair comparison between population groups with different age distributions. Age-adjustment is important in Connecticut as the median age of among the non-Hispanic white population is 47 years, whereas it is 34 years among non-Hispanic blacks, and 29 years among Hispanics. Because most non-Hispanic white residents who died were over 75 years of age, the age-adjusted rates are lower than the unadjusted rates. In contrast, Hispanic residents who died tend to be younger than 75 years of age which results in higher age-adjusted rates.\nThe population data used to calculate rates is based on the CT DPH population statistics for 2019, which is available online here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Population-Statistics. Prior to 5/10/2021, the population estimates from 2018 were used.\nRates are standardized to the 2000 US Millions Standard population (data available here: https://seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/). Standardization was done using 19 age groups (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, ..., 80-84, 85 years and older).

The grids were created by using rates of population change between decades from the coarser resolution History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) database to back-cast the GRUMPv1 population density grids. Mismatches between the spatial extent of the HYDE calculated rates and GRUMPv1 population data were resolved via infilling rate cells based on a focal mean of values. Finally, the grids were adjusted so that the population totals for each country equaled the UN World Population Prospects (2008 Revision) estimates for that country for the respective year (1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000).  These data do not represent census observations for the years prior to 2000, and therefore can at best be thought of as estimations of the populations in given locations. The population grids are consistent internally within the time series, but are not recommended for use in creating longer time series with any other population grids, including GRUMPv1, Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4), or non-SEDAC developed population grids.

        "description": "The United States Earthquake Intensity Database is a collection of damage and felt reports for over 23,000 U.S. earthquakes from 1638-1985. The majority of intensities are for U.S. cities, but there are also a few earthquakes and intensities for Panama (1925-1975), the Philippines (1926-1937), and Mexico (1887-1981). The data were compiled from various publications, newspaper reports, and special catalogs. The annual serial \"United States Earthquakes,\" is the principal data source and provides 90 percent of the observations. Most records in the file contain the date and time of occurrence and location of the earthquake, magnitude, focal depth, two-digit state code, name and coordinates of observing city or town, the observed intensity at each town, and the distance from city (or locality) to epicenter. The file consists of more than 150,000 earthquake intensity observations. The data file serves as an important information source for the preparation of intensity histories that are useful for environmental and hazard impact statements. The file is static and is no longer being updated.",

Version 3.0 incorporates new IAPWS standards adopted in 2008 for the viscosity and for the melting and sublimation curves and in 2011 for the thermal conductivity. The thermophysical properties included in the STEAM Database are: temperature, Helmholtz energy, thermodynamic derivatives, pressure, Gibbs energy, density, fugacity, thermal conductivity, volume, isothermal compressibility, viscosity, quality, dielectric constant, enthalpy, volume expansivity, dielectric derivatives, internal energy, speed of sound, Debye-H\u00fcckel slopes, entropy, Joule-Thomson coefficient, refractive index, Cv, surface tension, Cp, Prandtl number, Kinematic viscosity, Ionization constant (pKw), Virial Coefficients, Exergy. Using a Windows\u00ae interface, the STEAM database generates tables and plots of property values at specified conditions corresponding to saturation conditions, a fixed property value (isotherm, isobar, etc.), or individual values of two independent variables. Vapor-liquid, vapor-solid, and liquid-solid saturation calculations with either temperature or pressure specified are available. The user can specify which properties to display and the units in which to enter and display data. Additional features include an interactive on-line help system, the ability to plot calculated points and a wide variety of thermodynamic diagrams, and the capability to copy and paste data to and from other applications.",

        "description": "A. SUMMARY\nThese data represent hate crimes reported by the SFPD to the California Department of Justice. Read the detailed overview of this dataset here.\nWhat is a Hate Crime? \nA hate crime is a crime against a person, group, or property motivated by the victim's real or perceived protected social group. An individual may be the victim of a hate crime if they have been targeted because of their actual or perceived: (1) disability, (2) gender, (3) nationality, (4) race or ethnicity, (5) religion, (6) sexual orientation, and/or (7) association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. Hate crimes are serious crimes that may result in imprisonment or jail time.  \nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED\nHow is a Hate Crime Processed?\nNot all prejudice incidents including the utterance of hate speech rise to the level of a hate crime.  The U.S. Constitution allows hate speech if it does not interfere with the civil rights of others. While these acts are certainly hurtful, they do not rise to the level of criminal violations and thus may not be prosecuted. When a prejudice incident is reported, the reporting officer conducts a preliminary investigation and writes a crime or incident report. Bigotry must be the central motivation for an incident to be determined to be a hate crime. In that report, all facts such as verbatims or statements that occurred before or after the incident and characteristics such as the race, ethnicity, sex, religion, or sexual orientations of the victim and suspect (if known) are included. To classify a prejudice incident, the San Francisco Police Department\u2019s Hate Crimes Unit of the Special Investigations Division conducts an analysis of the incident report to determine if the incident falls under the definition of a \u201chate crime\u201d as defined by state law. \nCalifornia Penal Code 422.55 - Hate Crime Definition\nC. UPDATE PROCESS\nThese data are updated monthly. \nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET\nThis dataset includes the following information about each incident: the hate crime offense, bias type, location/time, and the number of hate crime victims and suspects. The data presented mirrors data published by the California Department of Justice, albeit at a higher frequency. The publishing of these data meet requirements set forth in PC 13023.\nE.

        "description": "These data represent the first ten years of data collection (2007-2016) on avian abundance/density and distribution in the National Capital Region as part of the Inventory and Monitoring Program. Data were collected following the protocol outlined by Dawson and Efford (2006). Point counts were conducted at roughly 384 forest locations annually across 11 National Parks during the breeding seasons from 2007 - 2016. Each site was visited twice per year by alternate trained observers. Species detections were recorded at each location as well as whether the bird was observed within 50m or between 50 & 100m from the observer. In addition, temperature, humidity, and weather conditions were also recorded. In 2014 the protocol was tested to see if it could be applied for monitoring grassland birds. During the 2014 field season 44 grassland monitoring plots were established at Manassas National Battlefield Park. The protocol was applied at these points and worked well. Since then monitoring was expanded to include grasslands in other parks including Antietam National Battlefield (ANTI) (89 plots), Harpers Ferry National Historical Park (HAFE) (26 plots) and Monocacy National Battlefield (MONO) (68 plots).",

        "description": "Version 4.0 of this data release provides descriptions of more than 200 mineral districts, mines, and mineral occurrences (deposits, prospects, and showings) within the United States that are reported to contain substantial enrichments of the rare earth elements (REEs). These mineral occurrences include mined deposits, exploration prospects, and other occurrences with notable concentrations of the REEs. The inclusion of a particular mineral occurrence in this database is not meant to imply that it has economic potential. Rather, these occurrences were included to capture the distribution and characteristics of the known, reported REEs deposits in the United States, which are diverse in their geology and resource potential.Concentrated, mineable deposits of the REEs are rare, such that most of the sites within this data release are for unmined locations where the published information may not contain thorough descriptions (Van Gosen and others, 2014). Therefore, decisions had to be made by the authors regarding the addition or exclusion of specific REE occurrences in the dataset, based principally on the available descriptions of the REE concentrations and the apparent size of the mineralized body. The level of detail of this type of information varied widely amongst the occurrences, ranging from general descriptions to detailed sampling and analysis of some deposits.The entries and descriptions in the database were derived from published papers, reports, data, and internet documents representing a variety of sources, including geologic and exploration studies described in State, Federal, and industry reports. Although an attempt was made to capture as many examples as possible, this dataset is a progress report that is part of an ongoing effort. The authors welcome additional published information in order to continually update and refine this dataset.In addition to the conventional resources described in this report, every year approximately 56,000 metric tons of REEs are mined, beneficiated, and put into solution, but not recovered, by operations associated with the global phosphate fertilizer industry (Emsbo and others, 2015, 2016). As indicated by Emsbo and others (2015, 2016), recovery of byproduct REEs from the phosphate industry has the potential to substantially increase the supply of REEs to the market.The significant increases in applications and demands for REEs has led to an increased interest in identifying new sources that include extraction not only from mineral deposits, but also the potential for REE extraction  from coal-based resources, and recycling of products containing REEs. The Department of Energy is currently (2019) evaluating technologies to recover REEs and other critical minerals from coal and coal-based resources (https://www.netl.doe.gov/coal/rare-earth-elements). Recycling efforts have focused on recovering REEs from light bulbs and electronics. The dataset provided in this data release is restricted to non-fuel, REE-bearing mineral deposits and does not include energy resources (such as coal).Van Gosen, B.S., Verplanck, P.L., Long, K.R., Gambogi, Joseph, and Seal, R.R., II, 2014, The rare-earth elements\u2014Vital to modern technologies and lifestyles: U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 2014\u20133078, 4 p., https://dx.doi.org/10.3133/fs20143078.Emsbo, Poul, McLaughlin, P.I., Breit, G.N., du Bray, E.A., and Koenig, A.E., 2015, Rare earth elements in sedimentary phosphate deposits\u2014Solution to the global REE crisis?: Gondwana Research, v. 27, p. 776\u2013785, accessed March 13, 2019, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2014.10.008.Emsbo, Poul, McLaughlin, P.I., du Bray, E.A., Anderson, E.D., Vandenbroucke, T.R.A., and Zielinski, 2016, Rare earth elements in sedimentary phosphorite deposits\u2014A global assessment, chap. 5 of Verplanck, P.L, and Hitzman, M.W., eds., Rare earth and critical elements in ore deposits: Reviews in Economic Geology, v. 18, p. 101\u2013114, accessed March 13, 2019, at https://www.segweb.org/store/detail.aspx?id=EDOCREV18.",

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as\nannual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit\ndrugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households\naged 12 and older. Questions include age at first use as well as\nlifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes:\nmarijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants,\nalcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including\npain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey\ncovers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for\ntreatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be\napplied. Respondents are also asked about personal and family income\nsources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal\nactivities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of\ndrugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous NHSDA\nadministrations were retained in the 1999 survey, including questions\nasked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\"\nitems covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment,\nillegal activities, gang involvement, drug use by friends, social\nsupport, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse\nprevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes\ntoward drug use and activities such as school work. Also retained were\nquestions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using\ndrugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving behavior and personal\nbehavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most\noften were introduced with the 1999 survey. Demographic data include\ngender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job\nstatus, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.",

SRI personnel developed an apparatus for determining the mass loss in vacuum and for collecting the outgassed products. Their report (Reference 1), which contained data from June 1964 to August 1967, served well as a foundation for selecting spacecraft materials with low outgassing properties. The apparatus was also constructed at GSFC and, based on the SRI data and GSFC data, a GSFC report (Reference 2) was published. That report included data for those materials meeting two criteria: a maximum total mass loss (TML) of 1.0 percent and maximum collected volatile condensable material (CVCM) of 0.10 percent.  After a series of tests and verification of procedures, an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Test Method was developed, based upon this apparatus. The method, 'Total Mass Loss (TML) and Collected Volatile Condensable Materials (CVCM) from Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment,' is identified as E 595-77/84/90.

        "description": "Note: As of July 21, 2021, this dataset no longer updates.\nA. SUMMARY\nData on daily hospital bed use and available capacity at San Francisco acute care hospitals from April 2020 onward. Long Term Care facilities (like Laguna Honda and Kentfield) are not included in this data as acute care patients cannot be admitted to these facilities.\nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED\nThis hospital capacity information is based on data that all SF acute care hospitals report to the San Francisco Department of Public Health.\nC. UPDATE PROCESS\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. This data is on a 4-day lag to account for the time needed to complete and validate data from all SF acute care hospitals. \nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET\nThis data provides visibility into current occupancy levels and use of San Francisco acute care hospitals and potential ability to accommodate anticipated surges of COVID patients. \nData includes current census of COVID-19 patients (including both confirmed cases and suspected COVID patients) and other patients in acute care hospitals, shown in the \u201cStatus\u201d column. The \u201cStatus\u201d column also includes all available beds.\nThis daily census information is stratified by type of bed (acute care, intensive care, and surge) in the \u201cBed Type\u201d column. Acute care beds treat patients with illnesses and injuries including recovery from surgeries. Intensive care (ICU) beds are for sicker patients in need of critical and life support services that can include the use of a ventilator. Surge beds are the additional beds that can be made available to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients; surge beds are differentiated between acute care surge beds and ICU surge beds.\nNote: The current census of COVID patients shown here may not always match the hospitalizations data (https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Hospitalizations/nxjg-bhem), as that data includes all hospitals and long term care facilities. As described above, those long term care facilities are not included here as they don\u2019t have the capacity to take in additional acute care patients and therefore aren\u2019t included in capacity measures.",

        "description": "The FHFA House Price Index (FHFA HPI\u00ae) is the nation\u2019s only collection of public, freely available house price indexes that measure changes in single-family home values based on data from all 50 states and over 400 American cities that extend back to the mid-1970s.  The FHFA HPI incorporates tens of millions of home sales and offers insights about house price fluctuations at the national, census division, state, metro area, county, ZIP code, and census tract levels.  FHFA uses a fully transparent methodology based upon a weighted, repeat-sales statistical technique to analyze house price transaction data.\n\u200b\nWhat does the FHFA HPI represent?\nThe FHFA HPI is a broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices. The FHFA HPI is a weighted, repeat-sales index, meaning that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or refinancings on the same properties. This information is obtained by reviewing repeat mortgage transactions on single-family properties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since January 1975.\nThe FHFA HPI serves as a timely, accurate indicator of house price trends at various geographic levels. Because of the breadth of the sample, it provides more information than is available in other house price indexes. It also provides housing economists with an improved analytical tool that is useful for estimating changes in the rates of mortgage defaults, prepayments and housing affordability in specific geographic areas.\nU.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, All-Transactions House Price Index for Connecticut [CTSTHPI], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CTSTHPI, August 2, 2023.",

From October 2022 \u2013 September 2023 this limit drops to 20%, and to 15% thereafter..\n(7) Payment rate is 13.75% of Gross Gaming Revenue.  Monthly payment is the greater of the calculated payment or $0 (if calculated payment is negative).\n(8) In May 2022, MPI Master Wagering License CT, LLC reclassified $2.6M of certain bets from October 2021 - March 2022 originally reported as resettlements, as winnings.\nThis had no impact on Gross Gaming Revenue or payments to the state because winnings and resettlements are treated the same in the GGR calculation.  Corrected amounts are reported above.\n(9) In May 2022, MPI Master Wagering License CT, LLC revised its October 2021 filing to reflect patron winnings that were cashed after the close of operations during the limited\nhours of Soft Launch.  This adjustment reduced the payment due to the State of Connecticut by $31,669; taken as a credit against the May 2022 payment due.",

HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED \nThe Office of the Chief Medical Examiner releases a monthly report containing the previous month\u2019s preliminary count of unintentional fatal drug overdoses. This dataset is manually updated based on that report. \nThe San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) investigates any unknown cause of death for deaths that occur in San Francisco. OCME uses drug testing, death scene investigation, autopsy, medical record, and informant information to determine the cause of death. Preliminary determinations are generally based on drug testing and death scene investigations. \nPreliminary deaths reported by the medical examiner consist of two categories: (a) cases that are still under investigation and involve suspected acute toxicity from opioids, cocaine, or methamphetamine; and (b) cases that have been finalized and were attributed to acute toxicity from any substance (including prescribed medication and over-the-counter medication).  \nC. UPDATE PROCESS \nThis dataset is updated monthly following the release of the monthly accidental fatal drug overdose report from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Department of Public Health staff manually copy data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner\u2019s report to update this dataset.  \nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET \nThis dataset is updated each month to include the most recent month\u2019s preliminary accidental fatal drug overdose count. Counts from previous months are often also updated as it can take more than a month for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to finish reviewing cases.  \nE. RELATED DATASETS \nSan Francisco Department of Public Health Substance Use Services \nOverdose-Related 911 Responses by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) \nUnintentional Drug Overdose Death Rate by Race/Ethnicity",

This dataset includes national and state eRx and health information exchange activity by community pharmacies and office-based health care providers active through the Surescripts Network. Surescripts is a health information network, and ONC procured electronic prescribing activity data conducted within its network from December 2008 through April 2014. The Surescripts network is used by the majority of all U.S. community pharmacies to rout prescriptions, excluding closed systems such as Kaiser Permanente. These include chain, franchise, and independently owned pharmacies. Data for annual percentages of new and renewal prescriptions routed through the Surescripts network exclude controlled substances.

The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas Shapefile includes the following legal entities: federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, state-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs).  The statistical entities included are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs).  Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile refer to areas that are administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes.  The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.  Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian/Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy.\nThe State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provides the legal boundaries for the HHLs. The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineated for the 2020 Census through the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) by participants from the federally recognized tribal governments.  The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list of federally recognized tribes and only provides legal boundary information when the tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation, or when another tribal, state, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or off-reservation trust land.\nThe boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2022, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\nThe boundaries for state-recognized American Indian reservations and for SDTSAs were delineated by a state governor-appointed liaisons for the 2020 Census through the State American Indian Reservation Program and PSAP respectively.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/turfgrass-soil-carbon-change-through-time-raw-data-and-code-39d74",
        "description": "Data Description\nManaged turfgrass is a common component of urban landscapes that is expanding under current land use trends. Previous studies have reported high rates of soil carbon sequestration in turfgrass, but no systematic review has summarized these rates nor evaluated how they change as turfgrass ages. We conducted a meta-analysis of soil carbon sequestration rates from 63 studies. Those data, as well as the code used to analyze them and create figures, are shared here.\nDataset Development\nWe conducted a systematic review from Nov 2020 to Jan 2021 using Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Michigan Turfgrass Information File Database. The search terms targeted were \"soil carbon\", \"carbon sequestration\", \"carbon storage\", or \u201ccarbon stock\u201d, with \"turf\", \"turfgrass\", \"lawn\", \"urban ecosystem\", or \"residential\", \u201cFescue\u201d, \u201cZoysia\u201d, \u201cPoa\u201d, \u201cCynodon\u201d, \u201cBouteloua\u201d, \u201cLolium\u201d, or \u201cAgrostis\u201d. We included only peer-reviewed studies written in English that measured SOC change over one year or longer, and where grass was managed as turf (mowed or clipped regularly). We included studies that sampled to any soil depth, and included several methodologies: small-plot research conducted over a few years (22 datasets from 4 articles), chronosequences of golf courses or residential lawns (39 datasets from 16 articles), and one study that was a variation on a chronosequence method and compiled long-term soil test data provided by golf courses of various ages (3 datasets from Qian & Follett, 2002). In total, 63 datasets from 21 articles met the search criteria.\nWe excluded 1) duplicate reports of the same data, 2) small plot studies that did not report baseline SOC stocks, and 3) pure modeling studies. We included five papers that only measured changes in SOC concentrations, but not areal stocks (i.e., SOC in Mg ha-1). For these papers, we converted from concentrations to stocks using several approaches. For two papers (Law & Patton, 2017; Y. Qian & Follett, 2002) we used estimated bulk densities provided by the authors. For the chronosequences reported in Selhorst & Lal (2011), we used the average bulk density reported by the author. For the 13 choronosequences reported in Selhorst & Lal (2013), we estimated bulk density from the average relationship between percent C and bulk density reported by Selhorst (2011). For Wang et al. (2014), we used bulk density values from official soil survey descriptions.\nData provenance\nIn most cases we contacted authors of the studies to obtain the original data. If authors did not reply after two inquiries, or no longer had access to the data, we captured data from published figures using WebPlotDigitizer (Rohatgi, 2021). For three manuscripts the data was already available, or partially available, in public data repositories. Data provenance information is provided in the document \"Dataset summaries and citations.docx\".\nRecommended Uses\nWe recommend the following to data users:\nConsult and cite the original manuscripts for each dataset, which often provide additional information about turfgrass management, experimental methods, and environmental context. Original citations are provided in the document \"Dataset summaries and citations.docx\".\nFor datasets that were previously published in public repositories, consult and cite the original datasets, which may provide additional data on turfgrass management practices, soil nitrogen, and natural reference sites. Links to repositories are in the document \"Dataset summaries and citations.docx\".\nConsider contacting the dataset authors to notify them of your plans to use the data, and to offer co-authorship as appropriate.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/treemap-2016-trees-per-acre-live-image-service",
        "description": "TreeMap 2016 provides a tree-level model of the forests of the conterminous United States.Metadata and DownloadsWe matched forest plot data from Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) to a 30x30 meter (m) grid. TreeMap 2016 is being used in both the private and public sectors for projects including fuel treatment planning, snag hazard mapping, and estimation of terrestrial carbon resources. We used a random forests machine-learning algorithm to impute the forest plot data to a set of target rasters provided by Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE: https://landfire.gov). Predictor variables consisted of percent forest cover, height, and vegetation type, as well as topography (slope, elevation, and aspect), location (latitude and longitude), biophysical variables (photosynthetically active radiation, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, and vapour pressure deficit), and disturbance history (time since disturbance and disturbance type) for the landscape circa 2016. The main output of this project (the GeoTIFF included in this data publication) is a raster map of imputed plot identifiers at 30X30 m spatial resolution for the conterminous U.S. for landscape conditions circa 2016. In the attribute table of this raster, we also present a set of attributes drawn from the FIA databases, including forest type and live basal area. The raster map of plot identifiers can be linked to the FIA databases available through the FIA DataMart (https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2001-FIADB). The dataset has been validated for applications including percent live tree cover, height of the dominant trees, forest type, species of trees with most basal area, aboveground biomass, fuel treatment planning, and snag hazard. Application of the dataset to research questions other than those for which it has been validated should be investigated by the researcher before proceeding. The dataset may be suitable for other applications and for use across various scales (stand, landscape, and region), however, the researcher should test the dataset's applicability to a particular research question before proceeding. This raster dataset represents model output generated by a random forests method that assigns Forest Inventory Analysis plot identifiers to a 30x30m grid (Riley et al. 2016 and Riley et al. 2021). Some attributes provided have been validated as detailed below, and we have high confidence they would be suitable for stand, county, and national scale analyses. Other attributes have not been validated as of this writing on 2/25/2022. Accuracy may vary regionally. This dataset is for the landscape circa 2016 and does not capture disturbances such as fire and land management after that date. Based on a set of FIA validation plots, these data have moderate to high accuracy at point locations for forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbance by fire and insects and disease (Riley et al. 2021). Summary statistics at Baileys section and subsection levels indicate high accuracy in most sections and subsections when compared to FIA statistics for live basal area, number of live trees greater than or equal to 1 diameter, live cubic-foot volume, and live-tree biomass. Estimates of number of dead trees greater than or equal to 5 diameter and dead tree above-ground biomass have lower correlations with FIA estimates, which are driven largely by the fact that TreeMap does not include areas where live tree cover is less than 10% while FIA does, meaning that severely disturbed areas are not included in mapping. In general, the TreeMap data are appropriately used for planning and policy-level analyses and decisions. Local map accuracy is suitable for many local-scale decisions regarding questions around forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbances. For other attributes provided here, formal validation has not been completed, and assessment at local scales is advised and must be driven by project-specific needs.

RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of loss of work due to illness with coronavirus for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included a question about the inability to work due to being sick or having a family member sick with COVID-19. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor work-loss days and work limitations in the United States. For example, in 2018, 42.7% of adults aged 18 and over missed at least 1 day of work in the previous year due to illness or injury and 9.3% of adults aged 18 to 69 were limited in their ability to work or unable to work due to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who did not work for pay at a job or business, at any point, in the previous week because either they or someone in their family was sick with COVID-19.

        "description": "The National Cooperative Soil Survey - Soil Characterization Database (NCSS-SCD) contains laboratory data for more than 65,000 locations (i.e. xy coordinates) throughout the United States and its Territories, and about 2,100 locations from other countries. It is a compilation of data from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) and several cooperating laboratories. The data steward and distributor is the National Soil Survey Center (NSSC). Information contained within the database includes physical, chemical, biological, mineralogical, morphological, and mid infrared reflectance (MIR) soil measurements, as well a collection of calculated values. The intended use of the data is to support interpretations related to soil use and management.\nData Usage\nAccess to the data is provided via the following user interfaces:\n1. Interactive Web Map\n2. Lab Data Mart (LDM) for querying data and generating reports\n3. Soil Data Access (SDA) web services for querying data\n5. Direct download of the entire database in several formats\nData at each location includes measurements at multiple depths (e.g. soil horizons). However, not all analyses have been conducted for each location and depth. Typically, a suite of measurements was collected based upon assumed or known conditions regarding the soil being analyzed. For example, soils of arid environments are routinely analyzed for salts and carbonates as part of the standard analysis suite. Standard morphological soil descriptions are available for about 60,000 of these locations. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is available for about 7,000 locations. Soil fertility measurements, such as those made by Agricultural Experiment Stations, were not made. Most of the data were obtained over the last 40 years, with about 4,000 locations before 1960, 25,000 from 1960-1990, 27,000 from 1990-2010, and 13,000 from 2010 to 2021. Generally, the number of measurements recorded per location has increased over time. Typically, the data were collected to represent a soil series or map unit component concept. They may also have been sampled to determine the range of variation within a given landscape.\nAlthough strict quality-control measures are applied, the NSSC does not warrant that the data are error free. Also, in some cases the measurements are not within the applicability range of the laboratory methods. For example, dispersion of clay is incomplete in some soils by the standard method used for determining particle-size distribution. Soils producing incomplete dispersion include those that are derived from volcanic materials or that have a high content of iron oxides, gypsum, carbonates, or other cementing materials. Also note that determination of clay minerals by x-ray diffraction is relative. Measurements of very high or very low quantities by any method are not very precise. Other measurements have other limitations in some kinds of soils. Such data are retained in the database for research purposes. Also, some of the data for were obtained from cooperating laboratories within the NCSS. The accuracy of the location coordinates has not been quantified but can be inferred from the precision of their decimal degrees and the presence of a map datum. Some older records may correspond to a county centroid. When the map datum is missing it can be assumed that data prior to 1990 was recorded using NAD27 and with WGS84 after 1995.\nFor detailed information about methods used in the KSSL and other laboratories refer to \"Soil Survey Investigation Report No. 42\". For information on the application of laboratory data, refer to \"Soil Survey Investigation Report No. 45\". If you are unfamiliar with any terms or methods feel free to consult your NRCS State Soil Scientist.\nTerms of Use\nThis dataset is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions but may be used as a reference source. This is public information and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service or the National Cooperative Soil Survey any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these data for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.",

Beneficiaries are considered to have left Medicaid or CHIP coverage if they have a gap in Medicaid or CHIP enrollment of at least 31 days or more or a full month within a state, or if they have left Medicaid or CHIP coverage in one state but have coverage through a different source with no break in coverage.\nThis table includes Medicaid or CHIP beneficiaries with full benefits in the month they left Medicaid or CHIP coverage. \n\u2018Marketplace or Account Transfer Consumers whose Medicaid or CHIP Coverage was Terminated\u2019 are consumers 1) whose full benefit Medicaid or CHIP coverage was terminated and 2) applied at the HealthCare.gov Marketplace or were sent via secure electronic file to the HealthCare.gov Marketplace in an inbound account transfer. \u2018Account Transfer Consumers whose Medicaid or CHIP Coverage was Terminated\u2019 are limited to consumers who were sent by a state Medicaid or CHIP agency via secure electronic file to the HealthCare.gov Marketplace in a process referred to as an inbound account transfer either 2 months before or 4 months after they left Medicaid or CHIP. 'Marketplace Consumers Not on Account Transfer whose Medicaid or CHIP Coverage was Terminated' are limited to consumers who applied at the HealthCare.gov Marketplace but were not sent by a state Medicaid or CHIP agency via secure electronic file to the HealthCare.gov Marketplace in a process referred to as an inbound account transfer either 2 months before or 4 months after they left Medicaid or CHIP.\nMarketplace consumers counts are based on the month the beneficiary left Medicaid or CHIP. Counts include all recent Marketplace activity.\nHealthcare.gov data are organized by week. Reporting months start on the first Monday of the month and end on the first Sunday of the next month when the last day of the reporting month is not a Sunday. Healthcare.gov data is through Sunday, July 2. \nData are preliminary and will be restated over time to reflect consumers most recent HealthCare.gov status. Data may change as states resubmit T-MSIS data or data quality issues are identified.\nSee the data and methodology documentation for a full description of the data sources, measure definitions, and general data limitations.\"\nData notes: \n The percentages for the 'Marketplace Consumers Not on Account Transfer whose Medicaid or CHIP Coverage was Terminated' data record group are marked as not available (NA) because the full population of consumers without an account transfer was not available for this report.\nUtah has a data quality issue and TAF data for this state are unavailable for March through May 2023.

        "description": "Exposure to sewage contaminated recreational waters may cause gastrointestinal illnesses in swimmers. The State of Hawaii Department of Health (HIDOH) Clean Water Branch (CWB) monitors the waters of Hawaii's beaches for concentrations of Enterococcus, which acts as an indicator of pathogens. The CWB also uses Clostridium perfringens as a secondary tracer of sewage contamination. Results of this monitoring are evaluated using a decision rule to determine whether a beach is safe (\"Compliant\") or not safe (on \"Alert\") for swimming and other water contact activities. If a beach is found to be on \"Alert\" due to elevated indicator bacteria levels, the CWB issues public warnings and alerts and determines whether resampling of the area is necessary.\nUnder the U.S. BEACH Act, the State of Hawaii receives an annual grant to implement its beach monitoring program. This requires the State to conduct a monitoring and notification program that is consistent with performance criteria published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2002. In March 2010, the EPA approved amendments to the Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR), Chapter 11-54, Water Quality Standards (CWB QAPrgP, HIDOH 2011, Appendix D), which revised the previous State Enterococcus criteria of a geometric mean (GM) of 7 colony-forming units (CFU) per 100 mL and a single sample maximum (SSM) of 100 CFU/100 mL to meet current EPA guidelines. The State of Hawaii now uses the EPA recommended Enterococcus GM and SSM for recreational waters consistent in the 1986 Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Bacteria. The criterion lists the GM and SSM for marine waters as 35 CFU/100 mL and 104 CFU/100 mL, respectively.\nThe CWB utilizes Clostridium perfringens as a secondary tracer in addition to the Enterococcus indicator to help distinguish between sewage and non-sewage sources of elevated Enterococcus levels in marine coastal waters. The reliability of Enterococcus as an indicator organism in tropical environments has been questioned. This issue was formally documented in the report, Tropical Water Quality Indicator Workshop (Fujioka and Byappanahalli, 2003).\nOne of the limitations of all available and EPA-approved test methods is that the sample must be incubated for about 24 hours. As a result, the public finds out today when they shouldn't have gone in the water yesterday. As a result, warning signs on the beach may or may not be reflective of actual water quality because they are based on tests performed one or more days ago.",

The Fair Housing Act prohibits most discrimination in housing transactions based on federally recognized bases (race, religion, familial status, etc.)  Cases are investigated by the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) within the Department of Housing and Urban Development or by state or local government agencies (FHAP agencies) who partner with FHEO to investigate these complaints.  Cases may be conciliated or settled during the investigation process, or there may be reasons why a case needs to be administratively closed, or else the investigation will determine whether there was cause to believe discrimination occurred.  If there is cause to believe discrimination occurred, the case will go through a legal adjudication process to be resolved.",

The demographic components of change (i.e., rates of fertility and mortality) for ICLUS v2.1 were taken directly from the Wittgenstein Centre Data Explorer (http://witt.null2.net/shiny/wic/). These projections were produced more recently than the Census projections used in ICLUS v2.0, and incorporate more recent observations of population change.\nSSP2 is a \u201cmiddle-of-the-road\u201d projection, where social, economic and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns, resulting in a U.S. population of 455 million people by 2100. Domestic migration trends remain largely consistent with the recent past, however the amenity value of local climate (average precipitation and temperature for summer and winter) is used in ICLUS v2.1.1 to influence migration patterns. The name of the climate model used as the source of future climate patterns is included at the end of the file name (e.g., \"GISS-E2-R\" or \"HadGEM2-ES\"). The approach for incorporating climate change into the migration model is described in the ICLUS v2.0 documentation.\nThe SSP5 narrative describes a rapidly growing and flourishing global economy that remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, and a U.S. population that exceeds 730 million by 2100. ICLUS v2.1 land use projections under SSP5 result in a considerably larger expansion of developed lands relative to SSP2.

The approach for incorporating climate change into the migration model is described in the ICLUS v2.0 documentation.\nRCP4.5 assumes that global greenhoue gas emissions increase into the latter part of the century, before leveling off and eventually stabilizing by 2100 as a result of various climate change policies.

Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units.

The datasets can be used by users (e.g., software developers, data scientists) who work on robot health management (including accuracy) but have limited or no access to robots that can capture real data. The datasets can support the:\n\nDevelopment of robot health monitoring algorithms and tools\nResearch of technologies and tools to support robot monitoring, diagnostics, prognostics, and health management (collectively called PHM)\nValidation and verification of the industrial PHM implementation. For example, the verification of a robot's TCP accuracy after the work cell has been reconfigured, or whenever a manufacturer wants to determine if the robot arm has experienced a degradation.\n\nFor data collection, a trajectory is programmed for the Universal Robot (UR5) approaching and stopping at randomly-selected locations in its workspace. The robot moves along this preprogrammed trajectory during different conditions of temperature, payload, and speed. The TCP (x,y,z) of the robot are measured by a 7-D measurement system developed at NIST. Differences are calculated between the measured positions from the 7-D measurement system and the nominal positions calculated by the nominal robot kinematic parameters. The results are recorded within the dataset. Controller level sensing data are also collected from each joint (direct output from the controller of the UR5), to understand the influences of position degradation from temperature, payload, and speed. Controller-level data can be used for the root cause analysis of the robot performance degradation, by providing joint positions, velocities, currents, accelerations, torques, and temperatures. For example, the cold-start temperatures of the six joints were approximately 25 degrees Celsius. After two hours of operation, the joint temperatures increased to approximately 35 degrees Celsius. Control variables are listed in the header file in the data set (UR5TestResult_header.xlsx). \nIf you'd like to comment on this data and/or offer recommendations on future datasets, please email guixiu.qiao@nist.gov.",

The data are from sensors deployed at standard heights over grass that is irrigated and mowed during the growing season to reference evapotranspiration standards. Sensors are duplicated at each height, and data from a duplicate sensor may be used to fill gaps in data from the primary sensor using appropriate regression relationships. Gap filling may also be accomplished using sensors deployed at one of the four large weighing lysimeters immediately west of the weather station. The primary paper describes details of the sensors used and methods of testing, calibration and use. The weather data include air temperature (C) and relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), solar irradiance (W m-2) and precipitation. Because the large (3 m by 3 m surface area) weighing lysimeters are better rain gages than are tipping bucket gages, the 15-minute precipitation data are derived for each lysimeter from changes in lysimeter mass. The land slope is <1% and flat. The mean annual precipitation is ~470 mm, the 20-year pan evaporation record indicates ~2,600 mm Class A pan evaporation per year, and winds are typically from the South and Southwest. The climate is semi-arid with ~70% (350 mm) of the annual precipitation occurring from May to September, during which period the pan evaporation averages ~1520 mm.",

Its objective was to enable clinical reviews to increase quality, reduce costs, and improve efficiency of the Prosthetics program. Increase the quality of the services to our Veterans by providing a means to develop consistency in services, review prescription and management practices, develop training, monitor Home Medical Equipment, and measure performance improvements. Reduce costs by comparing costs system-wide, identifying common items for consolidated contracting, identifying costs for Medical Cost Care Funds (MCCF) purposes and improving contracting cost benefit. Improve efficiency by validating the data, improving budget management, determining where coding errors occur, providing training, and comparing unique social security numbers for multiple site usage and item issue. The NPPD Menu provides patient information, patient eligibility, Prosthetic treatment, date of provision, cost, vendor, and purchasing agent information. This system tracks average cost data and its usage and provides on both a monthly and quarterly basis detailed and summary reports by station, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and agency. The NPPD Menu resides in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) at the medical center level. This data is updated quarterly. Data is rolled up at each facility and transmitted to Hines. The data is then loaded into the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) from which data extracts are done. The data is also put into a ProClarity cube and is available to VA local, regional, and national managers online. National managers have the ability to properly monitor, oversee and manage the national program and regional managers are able to effectively manage their respective areas using this tool. The primary purpose of this database is to provide financial and clinical oversight of the Prosthetics program and is used primarily by the Prosthetics and Sensory Aids (PSA) including VISN staff, VISN Prosthetics Representatives, Prosthetics Program Managers and other Prosthetics staff.",

The new divisional data set (NClimDiv) is based on the Global Historical Climatological Network-Daily (GHCN-D) and makes use of several improvements to the previous data set. For the input data, improvements include additional station networks, quality assurance reviews and temperature bias adjustments. Perhaps the most extensive improvement is to the computational approach, which now employs climatologically aided interpolation. This 5km grid based calculation nCLIMGRID helps to address topographic and network variability. This data set is primarily used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) to issue State of the Climate Reports on a monthly basis. These reports summarize recent temperature and precipitation conditions and long-term trends at a variety of spatial scales, the smallest being the climate division level. Data at the climate division level are aggregated to compute statewide, regional and national snapshots of climate conditions. For CONUS, the period of record is from 1895-present. Derived quantities such as Standardized precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Indices (PDSI, PHDI, PMDI, and ZNDX) and degree days are also available for the CONUS sites. \nIn March 2015, data for thirteen Alaskan climate divisions were added to the NClimDiv data set. Data for the new Alaskan climate divisions begin in 1925 through the present and are included in all monthly updates. Alaskan climate data include the following elements for divisional and statewide coverage: average temperature, maximum temperature (highs), minimum temperature (lows), and precipitation. The Alaska NClimDiv data were created and updated using similar methodology as that for the CONUS, but with a different approach to establishing the underlying climatology. The Alaska data are built upon the 1971-2000 PRISM averages whereas the CONUS values utilize a base climatology derived from the NClimGrid data set.\nAs of November 2018, NClimDiv includes county data and additional inventory files.",

        "description": "Digital elevation models (DEMs) of U.S. and other coasts that typically integrate ocean bathymetry and land topography. The DEMs support NOAA's mission to understand and predict changes in Earth's environment, and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has built many of these models, and also distributes DEMs on behalf of other NOAA offices, as well national and international partners. Bathymetric, topographic, and shoreline data used in DEM development come from a variety of sources, including NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) and NCEI, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as well as other federal, state, and local government agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. The DEMs are referenced to a variety of vertical tidal datums, typically mean high water (MHW) or North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88), and usually a horizontal datum of North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) or World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). DEM cell sizes range from high-resolution models (1/9 to 1/3 arc-second; ~3 to 10 meters) that support coastal inundation studies, to regional models (roughly 3 to 24 arc-seconds) that extend farther offshore, to global models (1 arc-minute; ~2 km).",

        "description": "Overview The Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the U.S. Department of State produces the Large Scale International Boundaries (LSIB) dataset, currently at Version 11.2 (published 01 February 2023). The 11.2 release is primarily a data refinement release, fixing attribute issues and applying updates to match the Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes (GENC) Version 3 Update 17. These data and their derivatives are the only international boundary lines approved for U.S. Government use. They reflect U.S. Government policy, and not necessarily de facto limits of control. This dataset is a National Geospatial Data Asset. DetailsSources for these data include treaties, relevant maps, and data from boundary commissions and national mapping agencies. Where available, the dataset incorporates information from courts, tribunals, and international arbitrations. The research and recovery of the data involves analysis of satellite imagery and elevation data. Due to the limitations of source materials and processing techniques, most lines are within 100 meters of their true position on the ground. Attributes The dataset uses the following attributes: Country Code: Country-level codes are from the Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes Standard (GENC). The Q2 code denotes a line representing a boundary associated with an area not in GENC. Country Names: Names approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Names for lines associated with a Q2 code are descriptive and are not necessarily BGN-approved. Label: Required text label for the line segment where scale permits Rank/Status: Rank 1: International Boundary, Rank 2: Other Line of International Separation, Rank 3: Special Line Notes Explanation of any applicable special circumstances Cartographic Usage Depiction of the LSIB requires a visual differentiation between the three categories of boundaries: International Boundaries (Rank 1) Other Lines of International Separation (Rank 2) Special Lines (Rank 3). Rank 1 lines must be the most visually prominent. Rank 2 lines must be less visually prominent than Rank 1 lines. Rank 3 lines must be shown in a manner visually subordinate to Ranks 1 and 2. Where scale permits, Rank 2 and 3 lines must be labeled in accordance with the \u201cLabel\u201d field. Data marked with a Rank 2 or 3 designation does not necessarily correspond to a disputed boundary. Additional informationCartography:\u00a0 Specific cartographic information can be found in Guidance Bulletins published by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues (https://hiu.state.gov/data/cartographic_guidance_bulletins/). Analysis: For US government and military users, additional boundaries information and analysis can be accessed through the Boundaries and Sovereignty Encyclopedia (BASE) web application maintained by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues.

        "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version. \nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency\u2019s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data into a Conterminous US-wide extent, and adding a Conterminous US-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added look up (valu) table containing \"ready to map\" attributes. The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format.\nThe raster and vector map data have a Conterminous US-wide extent. The raster map data have a 30 meter cell size. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that contains additional derived data.\nThe value added look up (valu) table contains attribute data summarized to the map unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.\nThe Gridded SSURGO dataset was created for use in national, regional, and state-wide resource planning and analysis of soils data. The raster map layer data can be readily combined with other national, regional, and local raster layers, e.g., National Land Cover Database (NLCD), the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Crop Data Layer, or the National Elevation Dataset (NED).",

Traffic monitoring data is a strategic resource for SHA and Maryland's Department of Transportation. The data is essential in the planning -  design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of state highway improvement and safety programs. TMS is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991 -  which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet SHA's long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent -  continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts.The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland's roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs -  located throughout Maryland. To date -  four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday -  respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority. A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers -  starting in 2006 -  to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where '0' represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014) -  '1' represents the count taken in 2013 -  '2' represents the count taken in 2012 -  '3' represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.

SUMMARY\nThe Department of Public Health and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development, with support from the Planning Department, created these 41 neighborhoods by grouping 2010 Census tracts, using common real estate and residents\u2019 definitions for the purpose of providing consistency in the analysis and reporting of socio-economic, demographic, and environmental data, and data on City-funded programs and services. These neighborhoods are not codified in Planning Code nor Administrative Code, although this map is referenced in Planning Code Section 415 as the \u201cAmerican Community Survey Neighborhood Profile Boundaries Map.\nNote: These are NOT statistical boundaries as they are not controlled for population size. This is also NOT an official map of neighborhood boundaries in SF but an aggregation of Census tracts and should be used in conjunction with other spatial boundaries for decision making.  \nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED\nThis dataset is produced by assigning Census tracts to neighborhoods based on existing neighborhood definitions used by Planning and MOHCD. A qualitative assessment is made to identify the appropriate neighborhood for a given tract based on understanding of population distribution and significant landmarks. Once all tracts have been assigned a neighborhood, the tracts are dissolved to produce this dataset, Analysis Neighborhoods.\nC. UPDATE PROCESS\nThis dataset is static. Changes to the analysis neighborhood boundaries will be evaluated as needed by the Analysis Neighborhood working group led by DataSF and the Planning department and includes staff from various other city departments. Contact us\nfor any questions. \nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET\nDownloading this dataset and opening it in Excel may cause some of the data values to be lost or not display properly (particularly the Analysis Neighborhood column).

        "description": "The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team. \nVersion 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  Final Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH. The derived result represents the final estimate of the Daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHH and giving the result in (mm). \nThe latency of the derived Final Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG Final Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with 2-3 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. \nIn the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1\u00b0x0.1\u00b0 (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\nThe CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the \u201cforecast\u201d and the IR estimates as the \u201cobservations\u201d, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about \u00b190 minutes away from the overpass time.\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide",

Variations in the \n          radiowave spectrum reveal characteristics of the corona and upper chromosphere in terms of altitude profile for the local plasma temperature, density and magnetic field. Typically, the lower \n          the frequency then the higher the height of origin. The frequency, like the solar electron density, decreases uniformly outwards with 245 MHz originating high in the corona whereas 15,400 MHz \n          originates in the low corona. Radio bursts are associated with solar flares. The delay at Earth of the different radio frequencies during burst events is due to the outward movement of the source. \n          Bursts can have temperatures of 10xE12 degrees Kelvin. Large bursts last 10 to 20 minutes on average. Longer radio noise storms of persistent and variable high levels of radiation originate in \n          sunspot groups, areas of large, intense magnetic fields. These storms are strongly circularly polarized due to the intense magnetic fields. The microwave wavelength 2800 MHz daily radio flux \n          correlates highly with the daily sunspot number and the two databases are used interchangeably. The 2800 MHz, or 10.7 cm, responds to the same conditions that produce changes in the visible and \n          X-ray wavelengths. Schmahl and Kundu (1995) find that the solar radio fluxes in the spectral range 1000-9400 MHz correlate well with the total solar irradiance. The intermediate frequencies \n          (at 2800 and 3750 MHz) are produced mainly by free-free gyroresonance emission from sunspot structures, while 1000 and 9400 MHz flux are produced mainly by free-free processes from structures \n          associated with plages. They can distinguish plage-associated emission from spot-associated emission in the time series of microwave flux, both contributing opposing effects on the total \n          solar irradiance.",

The Day/Night band (DNB) is a panchromatic channel covering the wavelengths from 500 nm to 900 nm, and is sensitive to visible and near-infrared during daylight hours as well as the low-level radiation observed at night. The shortname for this product is VNP02DNB.\nThe VIIRS DNB is much improved from previous products due in large part to its complicated continuous on-board calibration.

The corrections made to the DNB data are provided by the NASA VIIRS Characterization Support Team and are likely to continue to evolve given this new methodology.\nThe spatial resolution of the instrument at viewing nadir is approximately 750 m for the DNB and the Moderate-resolution Bands and and 375m for the Imagery bands. The DNB is aggregated to maintain nearly constant horizontal spatial resolution across the swath.\nAs the DNB is sensitive to nighttime radiation over the full lunar cycle, the incoming solar and lunar radiation must be properly modeled to calculate the reflectance.

EPIC provides 10 narrow-band spectral images of the entire sunlit face of the Earth using a 2048x2048 pixel CCD (Charge Coupled Device) detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope. EPIC collects radiance data of the Earth and other sources through the Camera/Telescope Assembly. EPIC has a field of view (FOV) of 0.62 degrees, sufficient to image the entire Earth. Because of DSCOVR's tilted (Lissajous) orbit about the L\u20101 point, the apparent angular size of the Earth varies from 0.45 to 0.53 degrees within its 6-month orbital period. Depending on the season, a complete set of per-band images is taken every 60 to 100 minutes.\nAccompanying instrument metadata and a series of calibrations and corrections are applied to properly convert the images to Level 1A format. The major corrections are for flat\u2010fielding and stray light. Flat-fielding is based on measurements with a uniform light source to measure the differences in sensitivity for each of the 4 million pixels. The resulting correction map is applied to the measured counts from the CCD. Stray light was measured in the laboratory using a series of small diameter light sources entering the telescope and imaged on the CCD. A similar set of measurements has been performed on orbit using the moon. The illumination of pixels outside the main diameter of the light source was measured to produce a detailed matrix map of the entire stray light function, and the resulting stray light correction is applied to every image. Other corrections are also applied based on laboratory measurements. For wavelengths longer than 550 nm there are back to front interference effects in the partially transparent CCD (etaloning) that must also be removed from the measured radiances.\nThe Level 1A products contain calibrated EPIC images with ancillary metadata and geolocation information. These data products are in HDF5 format.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/blm-natl-aim-riparian-and-wetland-indicators-hub",
        "description": "This feature class includes monitoring data collected nationally to understand the status, condition, and trend of resources on BLM lands. Data are collected in accordance with the BLM Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) Strategy. The AIM Strategy specifies a probabilistic or targeted sampling design, structured implementation, standard core methods and indicators, electronic data capture and management, and integration with remote sensing.\u00a0\u00a0Each record represents a sample visit during which a suite of the BLM Riparian and Wetland AIM methods were applied, with the geometry marking the center of the plot as taken in the Plot Characterization form. Attributes are the BLM Riparian and Wetland AIM core indicators, which include plot-level measures of vegetation and soil condition such as plant species cover and composition, plant height, and woody structure. In addition, some plots may have some contingent and annual use indicators, including measures of hummock cover and characteristics, water quality, stubble height, soil alteration, and riparian woody use. Data were collected and managed by BLM Field Offices, BLM Districts, and/or affiliated field crews with support from the BLM National Operations Center. Data are stored in a centralized database (BLM AIM Wetland Database) at the BLM National Operations Center. Annual Use data (i.e., annual use indicators) are omitted from the public version of these data but can be made available upon request.\u00a0\u00a0General Definitions\u00a0\u00a0The species list used for data collection was originally developed from a full download of all species in USDA PLANTS shown as occurring in BLM-administered states. The state-level occurrence of species in this list have been adjusted over time as individual species were found to be missing from individual state lists.\u00a0\u00a0Traits used in indicator calculations for all species observed at a given monitoring plot can be found in the I_SpeciesIndicator feature service, where the traits are listed by plant. A full species list can also be provided by request by the National Riparian and Wetland AIM Team. Once finalized, it will be added to the WetlandAIM database, likely in spring of 2024. In general, traits are assigned at the species-level. Genera and family-level records were only given trait values if all species within that taxonomic group were considered to have one trait (e.g., all species of Tamarix are nonnative, so the genus level code is also considered nonnative). To assign Growth Habit and Duration to unknown plants, information recorded in the Unknown Plants form was used to fill in traits. For example, if a plant was identified as a Carex species (unknown code CAREX_01), the growth habit (graminoid) would be taken from the full species list since all Carex species are graminoids, and the duration would be taken from the plot-specific matching entry in Unknown Plants.\u00a0\u00a0Nativity Status: The nativity status of all species was taken from the USDA Plants Database and was ranked at a national scale. All plants identified to species are \u2018Native\u2019, \u2018Nonnative\u2019, or \u2018Cryptogenic\u2019. The term cryptogenic refers to species with both native and nonnative genotypes. Genera and family-level plants were only given a nativity status if all species within that taxonomic group were considered either native or nonnative (e.g. all species of Tamarix are nonnative, so the genus level code is also considered nonnative).\u00a0Noxious: Noxious status are designated for each political state (i.e. StateCode) developed using the most recent state noxious list available online.\u00a0Wetland Indicator Status: Wetland Indicator Status was taken from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 National Wetland Plant List (NWPL 2020, version 3.5; https://wetland-plants.usace.army.mil/). Plants are ranked by ecoregion into one of the following rating categories based on an estimated frequency with which it is thought to occur in wetlands: obligate (OBL), facultative wetland (FACW), facultative (FAC), facultative upland (FACU), or upland (UPL), The five rating categories were first developed through an exhaustive review of the botanical literature and best professional judgement of national and regional experts, and has since undergone multiple rounds of revision by a national panel. C-Values: Coefficients of Conservatism (C-values) are assigned to species by a panel of experts, typically at a state level.\u00a0C-values range from 0 to 10 and represent an estimated probability that a plant is likely to occur in a landscape relatively unaltered from pre-European settlement conditions (see table of C-Value Interpretation below). The Mean C-value is calculated at a plot level by averaging the C-values of all species in a given plot. Mean C-value is a stand-alone indicator of floristic quality, one of several indicators under the Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) approach to assesses the degree of \"naturalness\" of an area.\u00a0C-Value Interpretation\u00a00 = Non-native species. Very prevalent in new ground or non-natural areas\u00a01-3 = Commonly found in non-natural areas\u00a04-6 = Equally found in natural and non-natural areas\u00a07-9 = Obligate to natural areas but can sustain some habitat degradation\u00a010 = Obligate to high-quality natural areas (relatively unaltered from pre-European settlement)\u00a0C-values were compiled from several sources, listed below.\u00a0CO = Smith, P., G.

If a pin hits both a live and a dead plant part in the same pin drop, that hit is considered live.\u00a0Growth Habit: The form of a plant. In this dataset, plants are either Forb, Graminoid, Shrub, Tree, and, in Alaska only, Liverwort, Moss, Hornwort, and Lichen. Growth habitat was derived from USDA PLANTS. If more than one growth habit was designated in USDA PLANTS, the most common growth habit was determined by consulting the USDA plants database and other literature and was applied across all states where it occurs. Graminoids include all grasses, rushes, sedges, arrow grasses, and quillworts (Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, Juncaginaceae, and Isoetes). Forbs include vascular, non-woody plants, but exclude graminoids. Shrubs are defined as perennial multi-stemmed woody plants usually less than 4-5 m in height. Trees are generally perennial woody plants with a single stem, normally greater than 4 to 5 m in height.\u00a0Duration: The life length of a plant. In this dataset, plants are either Perennial or Annual. Biennial plants are classified as Annuals. Duration was derived from USDA PLANTS. If more than one duration was designated in USDA PLANTS, the most common duration for each state was determined by consulting the USDA plants database and applied across all administrative states where it occurs.\u00a0Nonvasculars: Nonvascular species were not included in LPI data collection in the lower-48 except as generic \u201cnon-plant\u201d codes. In Alaska, a full list of nonvascular species from the Alaska Vegetation Plots Database (https://akveg.uaa.alaska.edu/) including mosses, hornworts, liverworts, and lichens was used during data collection. In terms of indicator calculations, nonvasculars were not included in plot-level plant counts and cover (i.e. cover of various plant trait categories like nativity, duration, or growth habit), but were instead transferred into the simplified non-plant codes to be calculated into moss and lichen cover indicators. Cover by species of these nonvasculars can be found in the SpeciesIndicators table.\u00a0Preferred Forbs: A set of specific forb species that are preferred by Sage Grouse birds. State preferred forb lists were developed by state botanists in collaboration with wildlife and sage-grouse experts and were based on a combination of peer reviewed literature and local knowledge. These lists were then combined to create one national list.",

While HABs occur frequently throughout the United States, the driving conditions behind them are not well understood, especially in flowing waters. In order to facilitate future national model development and characterization of HABs, this data release publishes a synthesized and cleaned collection of HABs-related water quality and quantity data for river and stream sites across the United States. It includes nutrients, major ions, sediment, physical properties, streamflow, chlorophyll and other types of water data.This data release contains files of harmonized data from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS). Continuous sensor data for 132 parameters (35 of which returned data) between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2022 were downloaded from NWIS programmatically. All data were harmonized into a shared format and grouped by generic parameters; data are in files named \"daily_{parameter_grp}.csv\", and the \"pcode_group_xwalk.csv\" maps parameter codes to parameter groups. Lastly, we include a \"site_metadata.csv\" containing site identification and location information for all sites with water quality and quantity data, and mappings to the National Hydrography Dataset flowlines where available.This work was completed as part of the USGS Proxies Project, an effort supported by the Water Mission Area (WMA) Water Quality Processes program to develop estimation methods for PFAS, harmful algal blooms, and metals, at multiple spatial and temporal scales.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/annual-california-sea-otter-census-2018-census-summary-shapefile",
        "description": "The GIS shapefile \"Census summary of southern sea otter 2018\" provides a standardized tool for examining spatial patterns in abundance and demographic trends of the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis), based on data collected during the spring 2018 range-wide census. The USGS spring range-wide sea otter census has been undertaken each year since 1982, using consistent methodology involving both ground-based and aerial-based counts. The spring census provides the primary basis for gauging population trends by State and Federal management agencies. This Shape file includes a series of summary statistics derived from the raw census data, including sea otter density (otters per square km of habitat), linear density (otters per km of coastline), relative pup abundance (ratio of pups to independent animals) and 5-year population trend (calculated as exponential rate of change). All statistics are calculated and plotted for small sections of habitat in order to illustrate local variation in these statistics across the entire mainland distribution of sea otters in California (as of 2018). Sea otter habitat is considered to extend offshore from the mean low tide line and out to the 60m isobath: this depth range includes over 99% of sea otter feeding dives, based on dive-depth data from radio tagged sea otters (Tinker et al 2006, 2007). Sea otter distribution in California (the mainland range) is considered to comprise this band of potential habitat stretching along the coast of California, and bounded to the north and south by range limits defined as \"the points farthest from the range center at which 5 or more otters are counted within a 10km contiguous stretch of coastline (as measured along the 10m bathymetric contour) during the two most recent spring censuses, or at which these same criteria were met in the previous year\". The polygon corresponding to the range definition was then sub-divided into onshore/offshore strips roughly 500 meters in width. The boundaries between these strips correspond to ATOS (As-The-Otter-Swims) points, which are arbitrary locations established approximately every 500 meters along a smoothed 5 fathom bathymetric contour (line) offshore of the State of California.References:Tinker, M.

        "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has generated land surface form classes for the contiguous United States. These land surface form classes were created as part of an effort to map standardized, terrestrial ecosystems for the nation using a classification developed by NatureServe (Comer and others, 2003). Ecosystem distributions were modeled using a biophysical stratification approach developed for South America (Sayre and others, 2008) and now being implemented globally (Sayre and others, 2007). Land surface forms strongly influence the differentiation and distribution of terrestrial ecosystems, and are one of the key input layers in the ecosystem delineation process.The methodology used to produce these land surface form classes was developed by the Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership (MoRAP). MoRAP made modifications to Hammond's (1964a, 1964b) land surface form classification, which allowed the use of 30-meter source data and a 1 km2 window for neighborhood analysis (True 2002, True and others, 2000). While Hammond's methodology was based on three variables, slope, local relief, and profile type, MoRAP's methodology uses only slope and local relief (True 2002). Slope is classified as gently sloping or not gently sloping using a slope threshold of 8%, local relief is classified into five classes (0-15m, 15-30m, 30-90m, 90-150m, and >150m), and eight landform classes (flat plains, smooth plains, irregular plains, escarpments, low hills, hills, breaks, and low mountains) were derived by combining slope class and local relief. The USGS implementation of the MoRAP methodology was executed using the USGS 30-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED) and an existing USGS slope dataset. In this implementation, a new land surface form class, the high mountains/deep canyons class, was identified by using an additional local relief class (> 400m).The drainage channels class was derived independently from the other land surface form classes. This class was derived using two of Andrew Weiss's slope position classes, \"valley\" and \"lower slope\" (Weiss 2001, Jenness 2006). The USGS implemented Weiss's algorithm using the 30-meter NED and a 1 km2 neighborhood analysis window. The resultant drainage channel class was combined into the final land surface forms dataset.",

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) participated in an international project to acquire radar data which were used to create the first near-global set of land elevations.\nThe radars used during the SRTM mission were actually developed and flown on two Endeavour missions in 1994. The C-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar and the X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) hardware were used on board the space shuttle in April and October 1994 to gather data about Earth's environment. The technology was modified for the SRTM mission to collect interferometric radar, which compared two radar images or signals taken at slightly different angles. This mission used single-pass interferometry, which acquired two signals at the same time by using two different radar antennas. An antenna located on board the space shuttle collected one data set and the other data set was collected by an antenna located at the end of a 60-meter mast that extended from the shuttle. Differences between the two signals allowed for the calculation of surface elevation.\nEndeavour orbited Earth 16 times each day during the 11-day mission, completing 176 orbits. SRTM successfully collected radar data over 80% of the Earth's land surface between 60\u00b0 north and 56\u00b0 south latitude with data points posted every 1 arc-second (approximately 30 meters).\nTwo resolutions of finished grade SRTM data are available through EarthExplorer from the collection held in the USGS EROS archive:\n1 arc-second (approximately 30-meter) high resolution elevation data offer worldwide coverage of void filled data at a resolution of 1 arc-second (30 meters) and provide open distribution of this high-resolution global data set. Some tiles may still contain voids. The SRTM 1 Arc-Second Global (30 meters) data set will be released in phases starting September 24, 2014. Users should check the coverage map in EarthExplorer to verify if their area of interest is available.\n3 arc-second (approximately 90-meter) medium resolution elevation data are available for global coverage. The 3 arc-second data were resampled using cubic convolution interpolation for regions between 60\u00b0 north and 56\u00b0 south latitude.\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",

This project is a cooperative effort between investigators at the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center's Marine Geology and Geophysics Division (NGDC/MGG), the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) and the Canadian Hydrographic Service(CHS). Bathymetric sounding data employed in compiling the one-meter bathymetry (National Geophysical Data Center, 1998) were collected over a 100-year period for purposes of navigation safety and nautical charting by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, the NOAA Coast Survey, and the Canadian Hydrographic Service. These bathymetric data, totaling several hundred thousand soundings, are separated four ways in existing archives: by whether they exist in digital form or reside only on paper sheets; and by whether they were collected by the U. S. or Canada. Final assembly of the new bathymetry has resulted from synthesis of bathymetric data from the four sources. Spacing of data control tracklines ranges from 500 to 2500 meters for the open lake and from 125 to 500 meters for nearshore areas. In preparation for bathymetric contouring, digital soundings were converted to metric units and computer plotted in color according to depth range. Contours in metric units were generated directly on overlays from paper sheets and then reduced to compilation scale and patched in. Compilation sheets were scanned and vectorized; and the resulting digital bathymetric contour data constitutes the primary product. The data were hand contoured by geomorphologists to capture and portray the maximum information available, resulting in a degree of detail not attainable with machine contouring and the density of available data. Bathymetric contours were prepared by geologists using sounding data contained in the paper archives at the scale of the survey sheets (scales ranging from 1: 100,000 to 1: 10, 000); or from sounding data contained in digital data bases at standard scales of either 1: 100,000 or 1: 50,000. Details concerning the methods of compilation are given in the western Lake Erie paper (Holcombe, et al., 1997). Bathymetric contours have been spatially reconciled with the NOAA Coast Survey nominal scale 1:80,000 digital vector shoreline, which by definition coincides with the Lake Erie low water datum, the zero-depth employed for bathymetric surveys and nautical charting.",

        "description": "Near real-time (NRT) NOAA-20 (formally JPSS-1) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Active Fire detection product is based on the instrument's 375 m nominal resolution data. Compared to other coarser resolution (\u22651km) satellite fire detection products, the improved 375 m data provide greater response over fires of relatively small areas, as well as improved mapping of large fire perimeters. Consequently, the data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity. The 375 m product complements the baseline Suomi NPP/VIIRS 750 m active fire detection and characterization data, which was originally designed to provide continuity to the existing 1 km Earth Observing System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (EOS/MODIS) active fire data record. Due to frequent data saturation issues, the current 375 m fire product provides detection information only with no sub-pixel fire characterization.\nVJ114IMGTDL_NRT are available in the following formats: TXT, SHP, KML, WMS. These data are also provided through the LANCE FIRMS Fire Email Alerts. Please note only the TXT and SHP files contain all the attributes.

        "description": "The Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI) funded agencies to develop programs to improve criminal justice, employment, education, health, and housing outcomes for released prisoners. SVORI was a goal-oriented initiative that specified outcomes that should be achieved by programs that were developed locally. The original Multi-site Evaluation of SVORI funded under NIJ grant 2004-RE-CX-0002 included a quasi-experimental  impact evaluation to determine the effectiveness of programming. Specifically, the purpose of the impact evaluation was to determine whether individuals who participated in enhanced reentry programming, as measured by their enrollment in SVORI programs, had improved post-release outcomes than comparable individuals who did not participate in SVORI programming. Impact evaluation data collection for both SVORI and non-SVORI participants consisted of four waves of in-person, computer-assisted interviews and oral swab drug tests conducted in conjunction with two of the follow-up interviews. The research team collected data on a total of 2,391 individuals including 1,697 adult males (Part 1), 357 adult females (Part 2), and 337 juvenile males (Part 3). As part of the impact evaluation, experienced RTI field interviewers conducted pre-release interviews with offenders approximately 30 days before release from prison and a series of follow-up interviews at 3, 9, and 15 months post-release. These data provided information on criminal history and recidivism occurring by December 31, 2007. The Adult Males Data (Part 1), Adult Females Data (Part 2), and the Juvenile Males Data (Part 3) each contain the same 5,566 variables from the 3 waves of offender interviews, 10 drug test lab results variables, and 3 weight variables. (Note: Some interview questions were only asked of adults, and other questions were only asked of juveniles.) Offender interview variables include demographics, housing, employment, education, military experience, family background, peer relationships, program operations and services, physical and mental health, substance abuse, crime and delinquency, and attitudes toward those topics. \n Under NIJ Grant 2009-IJ-CX-0010, the original Multi-site Evaluation of SVORI data were updated in order to examine the questions of, \"What works, for whom, and for how long?\" This included follow-up interview questions of those previously (and currently still) incarcerated. New variables derived from data collected under the original SVORI impact evaluation between 2004 and 2007 were also added to Part 3. Part one included an additional 100 variables, part two an additional 102 variables and part 3 an additional 99 variables.",

        "description": "Understanding the relationship between flood inundation and floodplains is critical for ecosystem and community health and well-being, as well as targeting floodplain and riparian restoration. Many communities in the United States, particularly those in rural areas, lack inundation maps due to the high cost of flood modeling. Only 60% of the conterminous United States has Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) through the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This EnviroAtlas dataset provides an estimate of the 100-year floodplain for the conterminous United States at 30-meter resolution to fill the gaps in the FIRM. The model hit rate for the CONUS was 0.79 compared to the FIRM, indicating that the model captured 79% of the 100-year floodplain identified by FEMA. This product provides complete coverage for the CONUS by identifying floodplains in areas without FIRMs, while also identifying floodplains in tributaries sometimes excluded by FEMA.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census and beyond, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Certain questions are asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Also included are questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Demographic information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.\nIn the income section, which was interviewer-administered, a split-sample study had been embedded within the 2006 and 2007 surveys to compare a shorter version of the income questions with a longer set of questions that had been used in previous surveys.

Current format is ArcGIS file geodatabase but older formats may exist as shapefiles.We converted the photointerpreted data into a GIS-usable format employing three fundamental processes; (1) orthorectify, (2) digitize, and (3) database enhancement. All digital map automation was projected in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, Zone 12, using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). To produce a polygon vector coverage for use in GIS, we converted each raster-based image mosaic of orthorectified overlays containing the photointerpreted data into a grid format using ArcInfo (Version 8.0.2, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, California). In ArcTools, we used the ArcScan utility to trace the polygon data and produce ArcInfo vector-based coverages. We digitally assigned map attribute codes (both map class codes and physiognomic modifier codes) to the polygons, and checked the digital data against the photointerpreted overlays for line and attribute consistency. Ultimately, we merged the 78 individual coverages into a seamless map coverage of GNP and immediate environs. We synchronized polygons and attributes along the boundary between the GNP and WLNP map coverages. Although GNP and WLNP are two separate map coverages, they are seamless in the sense they edge tie perfectly in both polygon location and map attribute.",

        "description": "Location of fish aggregation device (FAD) buoys within the Main Hawaiian Islands.\nFishermen in Hawaii and other parts of the world have long known that tunas and other pelagic fishes are attracted to floating objects. Fishermen have benefited from this behavior by fishing around floating logs, nets, debris and other flotsam. Hawaii has capitalized on this phenomena by placing FADs in the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands. In these waters, schools of tunas and other important pelagic fishes such as dolphin-fish (mahi-mahi), wahoo (ono), and billfishes can be induced to congregate and remain for periods of time in an area so that fishers can easily locate them. Thus, the FADs are used to \"attract\" and \"hold\" pelagic fishes in areas to enhance fishing.\nNOTE: Please do not rely on these buoys to check your position. Most buoys have only been located to the nearest 0.1 minute (6 seconds). In addition, each buoy has a watch circle that can be as much as 1 mile in diameter.",

        "description": "The Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) runoff database has the longest period of record of runoff in the world for a semiarid location, with data collection beginning in 1953. Runoff occurs at Walnut Gulch primarily as a result of convective thunderstorms during the months of July through September. Runoff volume and flow duration are correlated with drainage area as a result of the limited areal extent of runoff producing rainfall and transmission losses or infiltration of the flood wave into the channel alluvium. Runoff is measured at three ranges of watershed size: small, 0.0018-0.059 km2; medium, 0.35-1.60 km2; and large, 2.27-149 km2. The small watersheds are termed \u2018\u2018unit source area watersheds'' and were established to quantify the interaction of rainfall intensity patterns, soils, vegetation, and management on the rates and amounts runoff and sediment production. The medium watersheds were established at preexisting small earthen dams or stock tanks to obtain inexpensive measurements of storm runoff volume and annual sediment yield. The large watersheds were established to quantify the effects of the spatial and temporal variability of thunderstorm rainfall and channel characteristics on water yield, peak discharge, and sediment yield. Runoff was originally measured using a stilling well, float, and analog stage recorders (Stevens A-35, Friez FD-4, Friez FW-1) with mechanical clocks to record the timing of the event. In 1999, digital recorders consisting of potentiometers attached to the stilling well gear mechanism and a Campbell Scientific CR-10 data logger were added to all of the runoff measurement stations. At present, both the analog and digital data are being collected and are archived.",

        "description": "WARNING: On 2021/09/23 the EOS Aqua executed a Deep Space Maneuver (DSM). In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.\nThe thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the \u201cspectral_freq\u201d parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.\nUsers of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.

        "description": "The Rosa mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) migrate an average of 45 miles from northwest New Mexico to southwest Colorado. Their winter range is located in the upper San Juan Basin, east of the Navajo Reservoir, and is dominated by pinyon juniper woodlands and sagebrush grasslands. The Rosa herd utilize three distinct areas as summer range: the lower elevation Valle Seco, consisting primarily of ponderosa pine woodland and big sagebrush shrubland, and the higher elevation North and South San Juan Mountains, consisting of ponderosa pine and aspen-mixed woodlands. The herd collectively migrate northeast from their winter range for around 12 miles before a second route branches off the main corridor, with these individuals travelling to summer ranges in the Valle Seco and South San Juan Mountains. The main corridor continues for another 7 miles before splitting into three separate corridors that lead into the North and South San Juan Mountains. Challenges to migration include crossing US Highways 160 and 84 and increasing residential development around the town of Pagosa Springs. Ongoing and future energy development projects, including the drilling of well pads and use of maintenance roads, in the upper San Juan Basin may also cause disturbances to mule deer migration and their winter range. These data provide the location of migration stopovers for Mule Deer from the Rosa Herd in New Mexico. They were developed from Brownian bridge movement models using 402 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 68 adult mule deer comprising GPS locations collected every 2 hours.",

        "description": "This dataset consists of Level 3 weather radar products collected from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow), improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level 2 data are base products at original resolution. Level 2 data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level 2 quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level 3 products. The Level 3 data consists of reduced resolution, low-bandwidth, base products as well as many derived, post-processed products. Level 3 products are recorded at most U.S. sites, though non-US sites do not have Level 3 products. There are over 40 Level 3 products available from the NCDC. General products for Level 3 include the base and composite reflectivity, storm relative velocity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level 3 include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods, storm totals, and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level 3 are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure, hail index, mesocyclone identification, tornadic vortex signature, and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level 3 are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous.",

The generalized regions provide a framework for analysis, visualization, and regional comparisons of local data within the MAP.  Regions north of the Red River were based on those described by Ackerman (1996). The Grand Prairie region includes the area north and east of the Arkansas River and south and west of the White River within the MAP.  The Cache region includes the area north and east of the White River and the area generally west of Crowley\u2019s Ridge, which lies outside of the MAP extent (Painter and Westerman, 2018), bisects the northern part of the MAP, and has elevations 100 to 250 feet (ft) higher than the MAP (Ackerman, 1996). The Delta region, which is roughly equivalent to the Yazoo River drainage, lies predominately in Mississippi and covers much of the area east of the Mississippi River within the MAP. The Boeuf region covers the area north of the Red River and the Little Old River - Mississippi River confluence, the area south of the Arkansas River, and the area west of the Delta region within the MAP. The St. Francis region lies generally east of Crowley\u2019s Ridge and north of the Delta region in parts of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas. The regions south of the Red River and the Little Old River \u2013 Mississippi River confluence were based primarily on depositional environment (Saucier, 1994). The Atchafalaya region contains the Atchafalaya River. The Deltaic and Chenier Plains region lies south of the Atchafalaya region and covers the southernmost part of the MAP. In order to keep the regions contiguous, some relatively small parts of the Deltaic and Chenier Plains as defined by Saucier (1994) were included within the boundary of the Atchafalaya region defined for this study, and vice-versa.

These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across three main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities and (3) National Healthcare Safety Network (before July 15).\nThe file will be updated regularly and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days for all time. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.\nNo statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.\nThe below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column).

The distributed nature of NOAA Fisheries information systems, differences in collection authorities and confidentiality requirements increases the importance of this flexible technical architecture that can meet the changing needs for information at national, regional and local levels of resolution.  At the same time, the technical architecture is scalable to meet enterprise wide requirements for management of other types of fisheries data and fisheries independent data. Currently available via FOSS are the summarized, non-confidential, annual Commercial Landings by state as provided through the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP), the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Information Network (GulfFIN).  Recreational Landings estimates are available and provided via NMFS Headquarters.  In FY2011, FOSS will be expanded to include all commercial landings nationally.",

Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) geopackage. The file geodatabase format is supported with a 1.) ArcGIS Pro map file (.mapx) file (coso_geology.mapx) and individual Pro layer (.lyrx) files (for each GIS data layer), as well as with a 2.) 10.1 ArcMap (.mxd) map document (coso_geology.mxd) and individual 10.1 layer (.lyr) files (for each GIS data layer). Upon request, the GIS data is also available in ESRI 10.1 shapefile format. Contact Stephanie O'Meara (see contact information below) to acquire the GIS data in these GIS data formats. In addition to the GIS data and supporting GIS files, three additional files comprise a GRI digital geologic-GIS dataset or map: 1.) A GIS readme file (gewa_geology_gis_readme.pdf), 2.) the GRI ancillary map information document (.pdf) file (gewa_geology.pdf) which contains geologic unit descriptions, as well as other ancillary map information and graphics from the source map(s) used by the GRI in the production of the GRI digital geologic-GIS data for the park, and 3.) a user-friendly FAQ PDF version of the metadata (coso_geology_metadata_faq.pdf). Please read the gewa_geology_gis_readme.pdf for information pertaining to the proper extraction of the GIS data and other map files. QGIS software is available for free at: https://www.qgis.org/en/site/.

        "description": "Using a modified Thomas-Fermi approximation, we model a reference semiconductor system comprising a quasi-1D nanowire with a series of five depletion gates whose voltages determine the number of quantum dots (QDs), the charges on each of the QDs, as well as the conductance through the wire. The original dataset, QFlow lite, consists of 1 001 idealized simulated measurements with gate configurations sampling over different realizations of the same type of device. Each sample data is stored as a 100 x 100-pixel map from plunger gate voltages to (i) current through the device at infinitesimal bias, (ii) output of the charge sensor evaluated as the Coulomb potential at the sensor location - the experimentally relevant parameters that can be measured, (iii) information about the number of charges on each dot (with a default value 0 for short circuit and a barrier), and (iv) a label determining the state of the device, distinguishing between a single dot, a double dot, a short circuit, and a barrier state.The expanded dataset, QFlow 2.0, consists of 1599 idealized simulated measurements stored as roughly 250 x 250-pixel maps from plunger gate voltages to (i) output of the charge sensor, (ii) net charge on each dot, and (iii) a label determining the state of the device, distinguishing between a left, central, and right single QD, a double QD, and a barrier or short circuit (no QD) state. In addition, the QFlow 2.0 dataset includes two sets of noisy simulated measurements, one with the noise level varied around 1.5 times the optimized noise level and the other one with the noise level ranging from 0 to 7 times the optimized noise level.

        "description": "This dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2). \nData are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\nCauses of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.\nSOURCES\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\nREFERENCES \n\n\nNational Center for Health Statistics.

        "description": "We present a set of novel algorithms which we call sequenceMiner, that detect and characterize anomalies in large sets of high-dimensional symbol sequences that arise from recordings of switch sensors in the cockpits of commercial airliners. While the algorithms we present are general and domain-independent, we focus on a specific\nproblem that is critical to determining system-wide health\nof a fleet of aircraft. The approach taken uses unsupervised clustering of sequences using the normalized length of he longest common subsequence (nLCS) as a similarity measure, followed by a detailed analysis of outliers to detect anomalies. In this method, an outlier sequence is defined as a sequence that is far away from a cluster. We present new algorithms for outlier analysis that provide comprehensible indicators as to why a particular sequence is deemed to be an outlier. The algorithm provides a coherent description to an analyst of the anomalies in the sequence when compared to more normal sequences.\nThe final section of the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of sequenceMiner for anomaly detection on a real set of discrete sequence data from a fleet of commercial airliners.\nWe show that sequenceMiner discovers actionable and\noperationally significant safety events. We also compare\nour innovations with standard HiddenMarkov Models, and\nshow that our methods are superior",

Agencies are dispatched via a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system. This dataset contains dispatched EMS and Fire events from the CAD and includes details about the nature of the emergency.\nTo protect the privacy of callers and prevent sensitive health or other identifying information being revealed, the following steps were taken:\n\nAggregated event location to census block groups.  \nAggregated call date/time to quarter and year. \nShortened call types to remove potentially identifying information. \nFlagged certain call types as containing sensitive health information, such as mental health issues, overdose, etc.  \nChecked frequency of calls with sensitive health information: \nIf the number of calls (in a particular category related to sensitive health information) for a certain quarter/year and census block group was greater than or equal to 5, the call description was included.  \nIf less than 5, the call description was redacted. \n\n\n\nEvents requiring EMS and Fire services will appear in both datasets with a different Call ID. Events requiring two agencies of the same service (e.g. two or more different fire companies responded to a major fire) will only list the primary responder.\nThe call descriptions are based on information provided by the caller. The calls are not later updated with a disposition or correction if the original description was inaccurate. For example, if EMS is dispatched to the scene of a stroke, but the person actually had a heart attack, that record would not be updated later with the correct description. \nA small subset of the CAD data had no call type recorded. These records are preserved with a \"null\" in the Description_Short field. Redacted call types are listed as \"Removed\".\nThe 19 municipalities that dispatch their own EMS, Fire, and/or Police services are called \"ringdown municipalities\". These are subject to change. The list can be found in the Ringdown Municipalities 2019 resource.\nDue to the size of these tables, you may experience 504 Gateway Timeout errors when trying to download the first two resources below.

Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015, 2010-2014 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures from the 2014 BRFSS that are the same in the 2017 release as the previous 2016 release.

During the past several years, NREL CM research has shown that there are very few validation and verification efforts on commercial wind turbine CM systems. One of the reasons might be limited benchmarking datasets accessible by stakeholders. To fill this gap, NREL executed a data collection effort. The targeted users of these datasets include those investigating vibration-based wind turbine CM research, evaluating commercially available vibration-based CM systems, or testing prototyped vibration-based CM systems.\nNREL collected data from a healthy and a damaged gearbox of the same design tested by the GRC. Vibration data were collected by accelerometers along with high-speed shaft RPM signals during the dynamometer testing. The healthy gearbox was only tested in the dynamometer. The damaged gearbox was first tested in the dynamometer and later sent to a wind farm close to NREL for field testing. In the field test, it experienced two loss-of-oil events that damaged its internal bearings and gear elements. The gearbox was brought back to NREL and it was retested in the dynamometer with CM systems deployed under controlled loading conditions that would not cause catastrophic failure of the gearbox.\nThe objective of releasing these datasets to the public along with information about the real damage that occurred to the damaged gearbox is to provide the wind industry with some benchmarking datasets. These datasets will benefit research, development, validation, verification, and advancement of vibration-based wind condition-monitoring techniques.\nBy accessing this data you acknowledge the terms outlined in the \"License Information\" document.\nPlease contract Shawn Sheng (NREL) if you have any questions on the data or would like to collaborate on publications based on the datasets.",

        "description": "Declassified satellite images provide an important worldwide record of land-surface change. With the success of the first release of classified satellite photography in 1995, images from U.S. military intelligence satellites KH-7 and KH-9 were declassified in accordance with Executive Order 12951 in 2002. The data were originally used for cartographic information and reconnaissance for U.S. intelligence agencies. Since the images could be of historical value for global change research and were no longer critical to national security, the collection was made available to the public.\nKeyhole (KH) satellite systems KH-7 and KH-9 acquired photographs of the Earth\u2019s surface with a telescopic camera system and transported the exposed film through the use of recovery capsules. The capsules or buckets were de-orbited and retrieved by aircraft while the capsules parachuted to earth. The exposed film was developed and the images were analyzed for a range of military applications.\nThe KH-7 surveillance system was a high resolution imaging system that was operational from July 1963 to June 1967. Approximately 18,000 black-and-white images and 230 color images are available from the 38 missions flown during this program. Key features for this program were larger area of coverage and improved ground resolution. The cameras acquired imagery in continuous lengthwise sweeps of the terrain. KH-7 images are 9 inches wide, vary in length from 4 inches to 500 feet long, and have a resolution of 2 to 4 feet.\nThe KH-9 mapping program was operational from March 1973 to October 1980 and was designed to support mapping requirements and exact positioning of geographical points for the military. This was accomplished by using image overlap for stereo coverage and by using a camera system with a reseau grid to correct image distortion. The KH-9 framing cameras produced 9 x 18 inch imagery at a resolution of 20-30 feet. Approximately 29,000 mapping images were acquired from 12 missions. \nThe original film sources are maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Duplicate film sources held in the USGS EROS Center archive are used to produce digital copies of the imagery.",

As relative sea levels rise, high tide flooding (HTF) is occurring more frequently, even on sunny days.  HTF creates short term impacts like road closures, overflowing storm drains, and temporary business closures.  Over the long term, recurrent HTF causes more severe impacts like damage to below-ground infrastructure and degraded wetlands.\nThrough NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS), the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) and its predecessors have gathered oceanographic data along our nation's coasts for over 200 years to protect life, property, and the environment.  Serving both the public and other government agencies, CO-OPS is the authoritative source for accurate, reliable, and timely water-level and current measurements that support safe and efficient maritime commerce, sound coastal management, and recreation.  As part of those roles, CO-OPS offers a suite of interactive products that helps communities understand when, where, and how often high tide flooding may occur along the coast to better inform their coastal flood planning and mitigation efforts. The suite includes a summary of historical HTF days as well as Monthly and Annual HTF Outlooks which are produced for specific stations.",

        "description": "Volcanoes have contributed significantly to the formation of the surface of our planet. Volcanism produced the crust we live on and most of the air we breathe. The remnants of an eruption reveal as much as the eruption itself, for they tell us many things about the eruption. Included here are examples of several volcanic products and other magmatic features, with descriptions of how they were formed and what they tell us about volcanism. Most volcanic rock material begins as molten rock material formed within Earth and is called magma. Eruptive products include lava (fluid rockmaterial) and pyroclastics or tephra (fragmentary solid or liquid rock material). Tephra includes volcanic ash, lapilli (fragments between 2 and 64 mm), blocks, and bombs. Perhaps the best known volcanic product is lava, the fluid rock material that flows rather quietly from volcanic vents. The external and internal structures of lava flows are the result of the physical properties of the magma from which it was derived. Of these physical properties viscosity is the most important and it is in turn affected by the temperature and chemical composition of the magma. Lavas of low viscosity can spread great distances from the vent. Greater viscosity produces thicker lava flows that generally cover less area. The rate of supply of magma relative to the velocity of the lava as it flows from the vent and the external environment through which the lava flows also affect the structure of the solidified lava. Products of explosive eruptions include pyroclastic (fire broken) rocks and rock fragments. The force that produces explosive eruptions is the release of trapped gas. Ejecta from these explosions may be derived from the magma or from rocks in the vicinity of the volcanic conduit that are blasted out in the eruption. These may be ejected more or less vertically, then fall back to earth in the form of ash fall deposits. Pyroclastic flows result when the eruptive fragments follow the contours of the volcano and surrounding terrain. They are of three main types: glowing ash clouds (nuee ardente), ash flows, and mudflows. Volcanic structures can take many forms. A few of the smaller structures built directly around vents include cinder, spatter, and lava cones. Thick lavas may pile up over their vents to form lava domes. Larger structures produced by low viscosity lava flows include lava plains. The erosion of volcanoes leaves volcanic remnants, interesting reminders of the volcano's former fury. Erosion of the layers of lava and ash that built the volcano leaves the congealed magma in the conduit. This feature, sometimes referred to as a plug or the volcanic neck or throat, is a dramatic pillar of rock rising above the surrounding plain. These plugs or necks may be composed partially of fragments of the walls of the pipe and partially of congealed magma. They may be as more than a kilometer in diameter. Magma flowing into cracks in the rocks produces dikes, sills and laccoliths. This intrusive rock is generally resistant to erosion and often remains after the surrounding rock has eroded away. These exposed intrusive rocks give us a glimpse of the complex underground network of piping in active volcanoes. These igneous features are constant reminders of the timelessness of the processes that relentlessly form, and reform, the surface of planet Earth.",

        "description": "FEDEFL Inventory Methods v1.0.0 is a life cycle inventory analysis or grouping method for flows in the Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) (EPA 2019). Like the related life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods, this dataset includes collections of characterization factors for a given flow (e.g., NH3 to air) for a set of categories (e.g., acidification), provided in units of group equivalence per unit mass of the flowable. But the methods are simplified in that the factors are generally 1 as they only classify flows according to categories or groupings. These methods are typically used along with life cycle inventory data to provide indicators for reporting in life cycle assessment (LCA).\nThe groupings provided for FEDEFL flows in this method include land use, freshwater resources, water resources, mineral resources, energy, nonrenewable energy, renewable energy, hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and pesticides. \nThis dataset was created by the LCIA Formatter v1.0 (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter). The LCIA Formatter is a tool for providing standardized life cycle impact assessment and inventory methods with characterization factors transparently applied to flows from an authoritative flow list, like the FEDEFL. The LCIA Formatter used the fedelemflowlist v1.0.7 tool @ https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List, which subsets the flow list to create the various groupings with a combination of flow type and context matches, or by identifying matched flows in mapping files. Relevant mappings and explanatory notes are provided separately. \nThe zip file is a compressed archive of JSON files following the openLCA schema @ https://greendelta.github.io/olca-schema. Usage Notes for zip file: This file was tested to correctly import into an openLCA v1.10 database already containing flows from the FEDEFL v1.0.7. It will provide matching factors for any FEDEFL v1.0 to 1.0.7 elementary flow already present in the database that are classified in the provided groupings.  This file itself does not contain the elementary flows. The complete FEDEFL v1.0.7 flow list may be retrieved from the Federal LCA Commons elementary flow list repository @ https://www.lcacommons.gov.\nThe .parquet file is in the LCIA Formatter's LCIAmethod format. https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter/blob/v1.0.0/format%20specs/LCIAmethod.md\nUsage notes for parquet file: The .parquet file can be read in by any Apache parquet reader. \nReferences\nEPA 2019.

The surveys dated from 1930 to 1945. The total range of sounding data was 1.5 meters to -61.9 meters at mean low water. Mean high water values between 0.8 and 1.5 meters were assigned to the shoreline. Eleven points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data. These were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676). The Hudson River has eighteen 7.5 minute DEMs and four one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record). The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete.",

These L1B issues had a negative impact in varying degrees in downstream products,\nThe MODIS level-2 atmospheric precipitable water product consists of total atmospheric column water vapor amounts (and ancillary parameters) over clear land areas of the globe, over extended clear oceanic areas with the Sun glint, and above clouds over both land and ocean. The shortname for this level-2 MODIS total precipitable water vapor product is MOD05_L2. In Collection 6, MODIS column water vapor (MOD05) datasets continue to be separately available from infrared and near-infrared methods.\nThe estimates based on a near-infrared algorithm uses only daytime measurements with solar zenith angle less than 72 degrees. The retrieval algorithm relies on observations of water vapor attenuation of near-infrared solar radiation reflected by surfaces and clouds. The product is produced only over areas that have reflective surfaces in the near-infrared.

On February 11, 2019, the President signed Executive Order 13859, Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence. This order launched the American AI Initiative, a concerted effort to promote and protect AI technology and innovation in the United States. The Initiative implements a whole-of-government strategy in collaboration and engagement with the private sector, academia, the public, and like-minded international partners. Among other actions, key directives in the Initiative call for Federal agencies to prioritize AI research and development (R&empD) investments, enhance access to high-quality cyberinfrastructure and data, ensure that the Nation leads in the development of technical standards for AI, and provide education and training opportunities to prepare the American workforce for the new era of AI. In support of the American AI Initiative, this National AI R&empD Strategic Plan: 2019 Update defines the priority areas for Federal investments in AI R&empD. This 2019 update builds upon the first National AI R&empD Strategic Plan released in 2016, accounting for new research, technical innovations, and other considerations that have emerged over the past three years. This update has been developed by leading AI researchers and research administrators from across the Federal Government, with input from the broader civil society, including from many of America\u2019s leading academic research institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private sector technology companies. Feedback from these key stakeholders affirmed the continued relevance of each part of the 2016 Strategic Plan while also calling for greater attention to making AI trustworthy, to partnering with the private sector, and other imperatives.",

MRSA BSI data are submitted by hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). \nCDPH downloads California hospital MRSA BSI data from NHSN and analyzes the data to describe prevention progress in an annual public report of healthcare-associated infections. CDPH publishes annual MRSA BSI data reported by each California hospital in the datasets below. \nThe following datasets include the number of MRSA BSI reported by each California hospital in the specified reporting year. Beginning in 2016 for each California hospital, the annual MRSA BSI dataset includes the number of MRSA BSI that were predicted to occur in each hospital based on its specific facility-level characteristics. The observed (reported) number of MRSA BSI are then compared to the predicted number of MRSA BSI in a ratio called the Standardized Infection Ratio or SIR. The SIR is a metric that summarizes an individual hospital\u2019s MRSA BSI prevention progress compared with the national baseline and California state-specific prevention goals. \nThe datasets also include the associated 95% confidence intervals for the SIR and statistical interpretation to show whether MRSA BSI incidence was the same (no different), better (lower) or worse (higher) than the national baseline. Another performance measure in this dataset allows for tracking hospital progress in meeting national HAI reduction goals. Hospitals must have an SIR at or below incremental targets each year to be considered on track.\nDetailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest.\nFor more information about the SIR and NHSN\u2019s statistical models that are used to calculate the predicted number of MRSA BSI for each hospital, please review \u201cNHSN\u2019s Guide to the SIR\u201d: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps-analysis-resources/index.html \nFor general information about NHSN, surveillance definitions, and reporting requirements for MRSA BSI, please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html \nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, including HCAI, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk.\nFor information about healthcare-associated infection prevention progress in California hospitals and statewide prevention goals, please visit: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/AnnualHAIReports.aspx",

Three machine learning (ML) predictive models were developed for the prediction of vertical and two orthogonally oriented horizontal stresses in the well. The ML models were trained using laboratory-based triaxial ultrasonic wave velocity (labTUV) data wherein wave velocities were measured with various combinations of true triaxial applied stress. The ultrasonic velocities data include compressional, fast shear, and slow shear velocities in each of three directions for a total of nine velocities for each stress combination. However, because the ultimate goal is to deploy the trained model for interpretation of field sonic log data where only the vertically propagating waves are measured, the work here focuses on just the wave velocities with vertical (z-direction) propagation. Also, because vertical (overburden) is often well constrained, one approach explored here is to take the vertical stress also as known and train the model to predict the two horizontal stresses. This work was done as part of Utah FORGE project 2439: A Multi-Component Approach to Characterizing In-Situ Stress at the U.S. DOE FORGE EGS Site: Laboratory, Modeling and Field Measurement.",

        "description": "In the United States, a number of challenges prevent an accurate assessment of the prevalence of hate crimes in different areas of the country. These challenges create huge gaps in knowledge about hate crime--who is targeted, how, and in what areas--which in turn hinder appropriate policy efforts and allocation of resources to the prevention of hate crime. In the absence of high-quality hate crime data, online platforms may provide information that can contribute to a more accurate estimate of the risk of hate crimes in certain places and against certain groups of people. Data on social media posts that use hate speech or internet search terms related to hate against specific groups has the potential to enhance and facilitate timely understanding of what is happening offline, outside of traditional monitoring (e.g., police crime reports). This study assessed the utility of Twitter data to illuminate the prevalence of hate crimes in the United States with the goals of (i) addressing the lack of reliable knowledge about hate crime prevalence in the U.S. by (ii) identifying and analyzing online hate speech and (iii) examining the links between the online hate speech and offline hate crimes. \n The project drew on four types of data: recorded hate crime data, social media data, census data, and data on hate crime risk factors. An ecological framework and Poisson regression models were adopted to study the explicit link between hate speech online and hate crimes offline. Risk terrain modeling (RTM) was used to further assess the ability to identify places at higher risk of hate crimes offline.",

Some Medicaid eligibility groups cover additional services, such as nursing facility care and care received in the home. Others have higher income and resource limits, charge a premium, only pay the Medicare premium or cover only expenses also paid by Medicare, or require the recipient to pay a specific dollar amount of their medical expenses. Eligible Medicaid recipients may be considered medically needy if their medical costs are so high that they use up most of their income. Those considered medically needy are responsible for paying some of their medical expenses. This is called meeting a spend down. Then Medicaid would start to pay for the rest. Think of the spend down like a deductible that people pay as part of a private insurance plan.",

These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\nThe primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.",

They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.\nPotentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states.

It examined the human trafficking experiences (and to a lesser extent commercial sex acts) among a random sample of 60 counties across the United States. In contrast to prior research that had examined the issue from a federal perspective, this study examined experiences with human trafficking at the local level across the United States. The specific aims of the research were to:\nIdentify victims and potential victims of domestic labor and sex trafficking;\nDetermine whether they have been identified as victims by law enforcement; and\nExplore differences between sex trafficking and unlawful commercial sex.\nTo achieve these goals the researchers collected data through telephone interviews with local law enforcement, prosecutors, and service providers; a mail-out statistical survey completed by knowledgeable officials in those jurisdictions; and an examination of case files in four local communities. This latter effort consisted of reviewing incident and arrest reports and charging documents for a variety of offenses that might have involved criminal conduct with characteristics of human trafficking. Through this method, the researchers not only gained a sense of how local authorities handled these types of cases but also the ways in which trafficking victims \"fall through the cracks\" in the interfaces between local and federal judicial systems as well as among local, state, and federal law enforcement and social service systems.",

        "description": "Biochar is being evaluated as an amendment to improve soil characteristics to increase crop yields, revitalize degraded soils and facilitate the establishment of plant cover. Unfortunately, there are few rapid tests to determine potential effects of biochar on soil and associated plant responses. Seed germination (emergence of hypocotyl) is a critical parameter for plant establishment and may be a rapid indicator of biochar effects. We adapted Oregon State University Seed Laboratory procedures to develop a \u201crapid-test\u201d to screen for effects of biochar on seed germination and soil characteristics. Soils were amended with 1% biochar by weight and placed in 11.0 cm square x 3.5 cm deep containers fitted with premoistened blotter paper. Seeds were placed in a uniform 5 x 5 pattern and covered with 15 g of the soil-biochar mixtures. Two South Carolina Coastal Plain soils, the Norfolk (Fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kandiudults) and Coxville (Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Paleaquults), were used. Eighteen biochars were evaluated produced from 6 feedstocks [pine chips (PC), poultry litter (PL), swine solids (SS), switchgrass (SG); and two blends of PC and PL, 50% PC/50% PL (55), and 80% PC/20% PL (82).  For each feedstock biochars were made by pyrolysis at 350, 500 and 700\u00b0C for 1-2 hours.  Percent germination and shoot dry weight were evaluated for cabbage, carrot, cucumber, lettuce, oat, onion, perennial ryegrass and tomato. Soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and extractable phosphorus (EP), factors which can affect seed germination and early seedling growth, were determined after plant harvests.  Germination primarily was affected by soil type with few biochar effects. Shoot dry weight was increased for carrot, lettuce, oat and tomato; primarily with biochars containing PL. Soil pH and EC increased with PL, SS, 55 and most 82 treatments across soil types and plant species.  Soil EP increased substantially with SS and PL and to a lesser extent with 55 and 82 for both soils across species, and with SG pyrolyzed at 550 and 750\u00b0C soil for the Norfolk soil across species.  Thus, this rapid-test method can be an early indicator of the effects of biochar on seed germination and important soil health characteristics which can be affected by biochar and effect seed germination. \nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nOlszyk, D.M., T.

The tool provides both summary and detailed information at the Census block group level or a user-defined area for both demographic and environmental indicators. The summary information is in the form of EJ Indexes and Supplemental which combine demographic information with a single environmental indicator (such as proximity to traffic) that can help identify communities living in areas with greater potential for environmental and health impacts. The tool also provides additional detailed demographic and environmental information to supplement screening analyses. EJScreen displays this information in color-coded maps, bar charts, and standard reports. Users should keep in mind that screening tools are subject to substantial uncertainty in their demographic and environmental data, particularly when looking at small geographic areas, such as Census block groups.

        "description": "Overview: The QuitNowTXT text messaging program is designed as a resource that can be adapted to specific contexts including those outside the United States and in languages other than English. Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses.

        "description": "This is series-level metadata for the USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) data released by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  PAD-US is the nation's inventory of protected areas, including public land and voluntarily provided private protected areas. Starting with version 1.4 PAD-US was identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastre Theme ( https://ngda-cadastre-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/ ). The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling \"best available\" data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full PAD-US inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined PAD-US inventory.For more information regarding the PAD-US dataset please visit, https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/science/protected-areas/.  For more information about data aggregation please review the PAD-US Data Manual available at https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/pad-us-data-manual .A version history of PAD-US updates is summarized below (See https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/pad-us-data-history for more information): - Current Version - January 2022 (Version 3.0) https://doi.org/10.5066/P9Q9LQ4B- Revised - September 2020 (Version 2.1) https://doi.org/10.5066/P92QM3NT - Revised - September 2018 (Version 2.0) https://doi.org/10.5066/P955KPLE- Revised - May 2016 (Version 1.4) https://doi.org/10.5066/F7G73BSZ- Revised - November 2012 (Version 1.3) https://doi.org/10.5066/F79Z92XD- Revised - April 2011 (Version 1.2 - available from the PAD-US: Team pad-us@usgs.gov)- Revised - May 2010 (Version 1.1 - available from the PAD-US: Team pad-us@usgs.gov)- First posted - April 2009 (Version 1.0 - available from the PAD-US: Team pad-us@usgs.gov) Comparing protected area trends between PAD-US versions is not recommended without consultation with USGS as many changes reflect improvements to agency and organization GIS systems, or conservation and recreation measure classification, rather than actual changes in protected area acquisition on the ground.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nA tribal census tract is a relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a federally recognized American Indian reservation and/or off-reservation trust land, delineated by the American Indian tribal government and/or the Census Bureau for the purpose of presenting demographic data. For the 2010 Census, tribal census tracts are defined independently of the standard county-based census tract  delineation. For federally recognized American Indian Tribes with reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands with a population less than 2,400, a single tribal census tract is defined. Qualifying areas with a population greater than 2,400 could define additional tribal census tracts within their area. The tribal census tract codes for the 2010 Census are six characters long with a leading \"T\" alphabetic character followed by a five-digit numeric code, for example, T01000, which translates as tribal census tract 10. Tribal block groups nest within tribal census tracts. Since individual tabulation blocks are defined within the standard State-county-census tract geographic hierarchy, a tribal census tract can contain seemingly duplicate block numbers, thus tribal census tracts cannot be used to uniquely identify census tabulation blocks for the 2010 Census. \nThe boundaries of tribal census tracts are those delineated through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) for the 2010 Census.",

The algorithms are evaluated using data from the Electrical Power System (EPS), which simulates the functions of a typical aerospace vehicle power system. The EPS allows for the controlled insertion of faults in repeatable failure scenarios to test if diagnostic algorithms can detect and isolate these faults.\nHow Data Was Acquired\nThis dataset was generated from the EPS in the ADAPT lab. Each data file corresponds to one experimental run of the testbed. During an experiment, a data acquisition system commands the testbed into different configurations and records data from sensors that measure system variables such as voltages, currents, temperatures and switch positions. Faults were injected in some of the experimental runs.\nSample Rates and Parameter Descriptions\nData was sampled at a rate of 2 Hz and saved into a tab delimited plain text file. There are a total of 128 sensors and typical experimental runs last for approximately five minutes. The text files have also been converted into a MATLAB environment file containing equivalent data that may be imported for viewing or computation.\nFaults and Anomalies\nFaults were injected into the EPS using physical or software means. Physical faults include disconnecting sources, sinks or circuit breakers. For software faults, user commands are passed through an Antagonist function before being received by the EPS, and sensor data is filtered through the same function before being seen by the user. The Antagonist function was able to block user commands, send spurious commands and alter sensor data.\nExternal Links\nAdditional data from the ADAPT EPS testbed can be found at the DXC competition page - https://dashlink.arc.nasa.gov/topic/diagnostic-challenge-competition/\nOther Notes\nThe HTML diagrams can be viewed in any brower, but its active content is best run on Internet Explorer.",

This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time. (For more information, please see the narrative description.)\nThe California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an on-going telephone survey of randomly selected adults, which collects information on a wide variety of health-related behaviors and preventive health practices related to the leading causes of death and disability such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and injuries. Data are collected monthly from a random sample of the California population aged 18 years and older. The BRFSS is conducted by Public Health Survey Research Program of California State University, Sacramento under contract from CDPH. The survey has been conducted since 1984 by the California Department of Public Health in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2012, the survey methodology of the California BRFSS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey became dual-frame, with both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the BRFSS, and 3) raking or iterative proportional fitting was used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 \u2013 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond.

        "description": "This dataset contains numbers of COVID-19 outbreaks and associated cases, categorized by setting, reported to CDPH since January 1, 2021.\nAB 685 (Chapter 84, Statutes of 2020) and the Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Emergency Temporary Standards (Title 8, Subchapter 7, Sections 3205-3205.4) required non-healthcare employers in California to report workplace COVID-19 outbreaks to their local health department (LHD) between January 1, 2021 \u2013 December 31, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2023, non-healthcare employer reporting of COVID-19 outbreaks to local health departments is voluntary, unless a local order is in place. More recent data collected without mandated reporting may therefore be less representative of all outbreaks that have occurred, compared to earlier data collected during mandated reporting. Licensed health facilities continue to be mandated to report outbreaks to LHDs.\nLHDs report confirmed outbreaks to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) via the California Reportable Disease Information Exchange (CalREDIE), the California Connected (CalCONNECT) system, or other established processes. Data are compiled and categorized by setting by CDPH. Settings are categorized by U.S. Census industry codes. Total outbreaks and cases are included for individual industries as well as for broader industrial sectors.\nThe first dataset includes numbers of outbreaks in each setting by month of onset, for outbreaks reported to CDPH since January 1, 2021. This dataset includes some outbreaks with onset prior to January 1 that were reported to CDPH after January 1; these outbreaks are denoted with month of onset \u201cBefore Jan 2021.\u201d The second dataset includes cumulative numbers of COVID-19 outbreaks with onset after January 1, 2021, categorized by setting. Due to reporting delays, the reported numbers may not reflect all outbreaks that have occurred as of the reporting date; additional outbreaks may have occurred that have not yet been reported to CDPH.\nWhile many of these settings are workplaces, cases may have occurred among workers, other community members who visited the setting, or both. Accordingly, these data do not distinguish between outbreaks involving only workers, outbreaks involving only residents or patrons, or outbreaks involving both.\nSeveral additional data limitations should be kept in mind:\n\n\nOutbreaks are classified as \u201cInsufficient information\u201d for outbreaks where not enough information was available for CDPH to assign an industry code.\n\n\nSome sectors, particularly congregate residential settings, may have increased testing and therefore increased likelihood of outbreak recognition and reporting. As a result, in congregate residential settings, the number of outbreak-associated cases may be more accurate.\n\n\nHowever, in most settings, outbreak and case counts are likely underestimates. For most cases, it is not possible to identify the source of exposure, as many cases have multiple possible exposures.\n\n\nBecause some settings have been at times been closed or open with capacity restrictions, numbers of outbreak reports in those settings do not reflect COVID-19 transmission risk.\n\n\nThe number of outbreaks in different settings will depend on the number of different workplaces in each setting. More outbreaks would be expected in settings with many workplaces compared to settings with few workplaces.",

        "description": "Pocatello, Idaho historical orthomosaic for 1975 was created by collecting, scanning, merging and georectifying historic photography of Pocatello. The total spatial error is less than 1 meter. These historical orthomosaic images were derived using SfM (Structure-from-motion photogrammetry). SfM uses a series of overlapping images aligned to form a 3D representation. Classification resulted in raster and vector data with discrete classes grouped into objects located in the urban corridor of Pocatello. High-resolution aerial photography of the Pocatello area was provided by Valley Air Photos and the Idaho State Historical Society for 1975. All images were transferred from a traditional 9x9 photograph and scanned at a 1210 dpi resolution. (Date: 09/19/1975, Scale: 1:12,000, Total GSD [GSD = photo scale x scanning resolution]: 209, Scanned resolution: 11240x11240 1210 dpi). The general workflow for processing was as follows: Image collection, image pre-processing combined with gps positioning and differential correction. Photo alignment, point cloud generation, point cloud meshing, orthomosaic and DSM (Digital Surface Models) output. Photos were aligned using Agisoft Photoscan. Focal lengths for data sets were 152mm. GPS points were collected for ground truthing. Photo alignment, dense cloud, and mesh generation using ground control points, resulted in orthomosaics and DSMs (Digital Surface Models) for time periods. Orthomosaics were produced at a fine scale spatial resolution: .25m resolution in all cases except the final year at .5m due to differences in scale of the original imagery. Each orthomosaic and DEM was outputted at .5 m and 1 m resolution respectively, in order to maintain continuity between data sets. See Brock Lipple Thesis, 2015, for more in-depth discussion of the scanning and merging process.[http://geology.isu.edu/thesis/Lipple.Brock.2015.pdf].",

The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\nThe retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI methane product is a physics based method that uses the Oxygen-A band (760 nm) and absorption bands in shortwave infrared spectrum. In Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI methane algorithm, the atmosphere forward model simulates the absorbing gas (oxygen, methane, water vapor, and carbon monoxide) optical properties, as well as aerosol optical properties with size distribution, refractive index, and number concentration. The inversion is performed based on the forward calculation, the measurement, and the prior information. Cloud filtering is critical in methane retrieval, S5P methane algorithm applies re-gridded Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) cloud mask data. Additional cloud filters based on S5P/TROPOMI measurements and the FRESCO apparent surface pressure will be applied when VIIRS cloud data are not available. Other current data filters in the retrieval algorithm include land-only pixels (excluding mountainous areas), spectrum intensity, solar zenith angle and instrument zenith angle. \nThe S5P/TROPOMI methane retrieval is for non-time-critical (NTC) data stream only, and its main outputs include the column averaged dry air mixing ratio of methane, the random error, and the biased corrected dry air methane fraction data based on the retrieved surface albedo. \nStarting from orbit #12432 on March 7th of 2020, the S-NPP auxiliary cloud data source used in the methane product data processing has been transitioned from the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM) into the Enterprise Cloud Mask (ECM).\nThe data are stored in an enhanced netCDF-4 format.",

The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) module of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) asks respondents questions about eight different traumatic childhood experiences that occurred before the age of 18. These include verbal/emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and negative household situations including the incarceration of an adult, alcohol or drug abuse by an adult, violence between adults, mental illness of a household member, and parental divorce or separation. A cumulative ACEs score is calculated for each respondent by counting the number of these items that a respondent reported experiencing, creating a score ranging from 0 to 8.\n11 questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are condensed into a ordinal scale from 0 to 8 possible ACEs. This indicator shows the prevalence of adults who reported having 1 or more ACEs. However other data cuts are available, e.g., 3 or more ACEs The ACEs module is a very \"lagging\" indicator capturing childhood experiences retrospectively by asking adults 18+ years of age.  Additional limitations include: 1) relies on self-reported information, 2) provides prevalence, not incidence data, 3) bias or measurement error associated with telephone-administered survey of a sample of the population (e.g., response bias, sampling variation), 4) designed to provide state-level population health estimates and does not provide sub-state estimates or estimates by racial sub-groups (e.g., Asian sub-groups) unless multiple years are combined. Because of the changes in the methodology, researchers are advised to avoid comparing data collected before the changes (up to 2010) with data collected from 2011 and onward: http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2013/pdf/compare_2013.pdf.
