The Factors are based on GHG data representing 2019. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors (SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_CO2e_USD2021.csv) provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per USD for all GHGs combined using 100 yr global warming potentials from the 4th IPPC Assessment report to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors (SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_byGHG_USD2021.csv) provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar (USD) in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices in 2021 USD.

        "description": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For the most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page (updated weekly) or Vision Zero View (updated monthly).\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department\u2019s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists. \nThe ZCTA boundaries in this release are those delineated following the 2010 Census.",

        "description": "Many organizations quantify greenhouse emissions in their value chain. Emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods, referred to as Scope 3 emissions in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard, represent a significant emissions source for many organizations. To assist in quantifying these emissions, we have developed a comprehensive set of supply chain emission factors covering all categories of goods and services in the US economy. These factors are intended for quantifying emissions from purchased goods and services using the spend-based method defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions. The factors were prepared using USEEIO models, which are a life cycle models of goods and services in the US economy.\nThe supply chain emission factors are presented in units of kilogram emissions per US dollar of purchases for a category of goods and services with a defined life cycle scope. Sets of factors covering all sectors of the economy are provided for years from 2010 to 2016 with two levels of sector aggregation. The factors are provided for both industries and commodities, where commodities are equivalent to a category of good or service, and industries are producers of one or more commodities. A set of five data quality scores covering data reliability, temporal, geographical and technological correlation and completeness of data collection is provided along with each factor.\nThe factors presented are as follows:\n1. Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins: emissions associated with cradle to factory gate\n2. Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors: emissions associated with factory gate to shelf, which includes emissions from transportation, wholesale and retail as well as adjustments for price markups\n3. Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins: emissions associated with cradle to shelf (equal to the sum of the above two factors)\nEnd users of products will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins most appropriate for their use. Organizations purchasing intermediate products at the factory gate will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins to be most appropriate.\nSee the Executive Summary of the associated report for an example calculation using the factors.\nAll factors are associated with limitations and variations in underlying data quality. We encourage the reader to carefully read the report to understand the differences across these sets, underlying assumptions in their calculation, their limitations to decide if they are appropriate for their intended use. If the reader deems the factors are appropriate, this report along with the factor data quality scores will aid in selection of factors best fit for their intended use. \nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nIngwersen, W., and M.

In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.\nThe boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2019, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).",

        "description": "The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and\n    correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use\n    of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as\n    lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco,\n    and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment\n    history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic\n    criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were\n    also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting\n    from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey, including questions asked\n    only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug\n    use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes\n    toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on\n    mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking.\n    Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to\n    measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a\n    split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.\n    Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race,\n    age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.",

Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form. The current version of the SR1050 instructions manual with detailed information on each data elements is available here.\nAs per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here.",

People who live and/or work in compact neighborhoods with a walkable street grid and easy access to public transit, jobs, stores, and services are more likely to have several transportation options to meet their everyday needs. As a result, they can choose to drive less, which reduces their emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants compared to people who live and work in places that are not location efficient. Walking, biking, and taking public transit can also save people money and improve their health by encouraging physical activity.\nThe Smart Location Database summarizes several demographic, employment, and built environment variables for every census block group (CBG) in the United States. The database includes indicators of the commonly cited \u201cD\u201d variables shown in the transportation research literature to be related to travel behavior.  The Ds include residential and employment density, land use diversity, design of the built environment, access to destinations, and distance to transit. SLD variables can be used as inputs to travel demand models, baseline data for scenario planning studies, and combined into composite indicators characterizing the relative location efficiency of CBG within U.S. metropolitan regions.\nThis update features the most recent geographic boundaries (2019 Census Block Groups) and new and expanded sources of data used to calculate variables. Entirely new variables have been added and the methods used to calculate some of the SLD variables have changed.\nMore information on the National Walkability index: https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping\nMore information on the Smart Location Calculator: https://www.slc.gsa.gov/slc/",

Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data.

Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as \u201cMorphine (not heroin).\u201d  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.\n\u201cAny Opioid\u201d \u2013 If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it\u2019s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results, that column may be checked",

In addition to the 2004 NSDUH data, the study utilized new variables that were derived from the original dataset by the principal investigator, namely recoded variables, interaction variables, and computed indices. Information was provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 years and older. Respondents also provided detailed information regarding criminal activity, depression, and other factors. A total of 55,602 respondents participated in the study. The dataset contains a total of 3,011 variables. The first 2,690 variables are drawn from the 2004 NSDUH dataset and the remaining 321 variables were created by the principal investigator.  Variables created by the principal investigator are manipulations of the first 2,690 variables. Specifically, these variables include depression indices, drug dependence indicators, interactions with gender and other demographic variables, and dichotomous recoded variables relating to types of drug abuse and criminal behavior.",

        "description": "This web service contains the following state level layers:Ozone 8-hr (1997 standard), Ozone 8-hr (2008 standard), Lead (2008 standard), SO2 1-hr (2010 standard), PM2.5 24hr (2006 standard), PM2.5 Annual (1997 standard), PM2.5 Annual (2012 standard), PM10 (1987 standard), and CO (1990 standard). Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (https://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NonattainmentAreas/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. These layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants and have been designated \"nonattainment\u00e2\u0080\u009d areas (NAA)\". The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \"attainment\" (meeting), \"nonattainment\" (not meeting), or \"unclassifiable\" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to: https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/index.html. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (https://www.epa.gov/approved-sips/regional-sip-coordinators). EPA Headquarters should be contacted only when the Regional Office is unable to answer a question.",

If a tile crosses two UTM zones, it is        delivered in both zones. The one-meter DEM is the highest resolution standard DEM offered in        the 3DEP product suite. Other 3DEP products are nationally seamless DEMs in resolutions of        1/3, 1, and 2 arc seconds. These seamless DEMs were referred to as the National Elevation        Dataset (NED) from about 2000 through 2015 at which time they became the seamless DEM layers        under the 3DEP program and the NED name and system were retired. Other 3DEP products include        five-meter DEMs in Alaska as well as various source datasets including the lidar point cloud        and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Ifsar) digital surface models and intensity        images. All 3DEP products are public domain.",

For the 2010 Census and beyond, tribal census tracts are defined independently of the standard county-based census tract  delineation. For federally recognized American Indian Tribes with reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands with a population less than 2,400, a single tribal census tract is defined. Qualifying areas with a population greater than 2,400 could define additional tribal census tracts within their area. The tribal census tract codes for the 2020 Census are six characters long with a leading \"T\" alphabetic character followed by a five-digit numeric code, for example, T01000, which translates as tribal census tract 10. Tribal block groups nest within tribal census tracts. Since individual tabulation blocks are defined within the standard State-county-census tract geographic hierarchy, a tribal census tract can contain seemingly duplicate block numbers, thus tribal census tracts cannot be used to uniquely identify census tabulation blocks for the 2020 Census. \nThe boundaries of tribal census tracts are those delineated through the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2020 Census.",

        "description": "The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient care database in the United States. The NIS is designed to produce U.S. regional and national estimates of inpatient utilization, access, cost, quality, and outcomes. Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7 million hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations nationally. Developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), HCUP data inform decision making at the national, State, and community levels.\nStarting with the 2012 data year, the NIS is a sample of discharges from all hospitals participating in HCUP, covering more than 97 percent of the U.S. population. For prior years, the NIS was a sample of hospitals. The NIS allows for weighted national estimates to identify, track, and analyze national trends in health care utilization, access, charges, quality, and outcomes. The NIS's large sample size enables analyses of rare conditions, such as congenital anomalies; uncommon treatments, such as organ transplantation; and special patient populations, such as the uninsured. NIS data are available since 1988, allowing analysis of trends over time. \nThe NIS inpatient data include clinical and resource use information typically available from discharge abstracts with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources).  Data elements include but are not limited to: diagnoses, procedures, discharge status, patient demographics (e.g., gender, age), total charges, length of stay, and expected payment source, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay, or those billed as \u2018no charge\u2019. The NIS excludes data elements that could directly or indirectly identify individuals. \nRestricted access data files are available with a data use agreement and brief online security training.",

        "description": "Note: This dataset has been superseded by the dataset found at \"End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock\" (submission 4520; linked in the submission resources), which is a comprehensive and validated representation of hourly load profiles in the U.S. commercial and residential building stock. The End-Use Load Profiles project website includes links to data viewers for this new dataset. For documentation of dataset validation, model calibration, and uncertainty quantification, see Wilson et al. (2022). \nThese  data were first created around 2012 as a byproduct of various analyses of solar photovoltaics and solar water heating (see references below for are two examples).  This dataset contains several errors and limitations. It is recommended that users of this dataset transition to the updated version of the dataset posted in the resources.  This dataset contains weather data, commercial load profile data, and residential load profile data.\nWeather\nThe Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3) provides one year of hourly data for around 1,000 locations. The TMY weather represents 30-year normals, which are typical weather conditions over a 30-year period.\nCommercial\nThe commercial load profiles included are the 16 ASHRAE 90.1-2004 DOE Commercial Prototype Models simulated in all TMY3 locations, with building insulation levels changing based on ASHRAE 90.1-2004 requirements in each climate zone. The folder names within each resource represent the weather station location of the profiles, whereas the file names represent the building type and the representative city for the ASHRAE climate zone that was used to determine code compliance insulation levels. As indicated by the file names, all building models represent construction that complied with the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 building energy code requirements. No older or newer vintages of buildings are represented.\nResidential \nThe BASE residential load profiles are five EnergyPlus models (one per climate region) representing 2009 IECC construction single-family detached homes simulated in all TMY3 locations. No older or newer vintages of buildings are represented. Each of the five climate regions include only one heating fuel type; electric heating is only found in the Hot-Humid climate. Air conditioning is not found in the Marine climate region.\nOne major issue with the residential profiles is that for each of the five climate zones, certain location-specific algorithms from one city were applied to entire climate zones. For example, in the Hot-Humid files, the heating season calculated for Tampa, FL (December 1 - March 31) was unknowingly applied to all other locations in the Hot-Humid zone, which restricts heating operation outside of those days (for example, heating is disabled in Dallas, TX during cold weather in November). This causes the heating energy to be artificially low in colder parts of that climate zone, and conversely the cooling season restriction leads to artificially low cooling energy use in hotter parts of each climate zone. Additionally, the ground temperatures for the representative city were used across the entire climate zone. This affects water heating energy use (because inlet cold water temperature depends on ground temperature) and heating/cooling energy use (because of ground heat transfer through foundation walls and floors). Representative cities were Tampa, FL (Hot-Humid), El Paso, TX (Mixed-Dry/Hot-Dry), Memphis, TN (Mixed-Humid), Arcata, CA (Marine), and Billings, MT (Cold/Very-Cold).\nThe residential dataset includes a HIGH building load profile that was intended to provide a rough approximation of older home vintages, but it combines poor thermal insulation with larger house size, tighter thermostat setpoints, and less efficient HVAC equipment. Conversely, the LOW building combines excellent thermal insulation with smaller house size, wider thermostat setpoints, and more efficient HVAC equipment. However, it is not known how well these HIGH and LOW permutations represent the range of energy use in the housing stock.\nNote that on July 2nd, 2013, the Residential High and Low load files were updated from 366 days in a year for leap years to the more general 365 days in a normal year. The archived residential load data is included from prior to this date.",

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). In addition to the standard set of normals, users also can find \"agricultural normals\", which are used in many industries, including but not limited to construction, architecture, pest control, etc. These supplemental \"agricultural normals\" include frost-freeze date probabilities, growing degree day normals, probabilities of reaching minimum temperature thresholds, and growing season length normals. Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries.

        "description": "Updates are delayed due to technical difficulties.\nHow many people are staying at home? How far are people traveling when they don\u2019t stay home? Which states and counties have more people taking trips? The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) now provides answers to those questions through our new mobility statistics.\nThe Trips by Distance data and number of people staying home and not staying home are estimated for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. Data analysis is conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels. A weighting procedure expands the sample of millions of mobile devices, so the results are representative of the entire population in a nation, state, or county. To assure confidentiality and support data quality, no data are reported for a county if it has fewer than 50 devices in the sample on any given day.\nTrips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. Home locations are imputed on a weekly basis. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes before returning home is counted as multiple trips. Trips capture travel by all modes of transportation. including driving, rail, transit, and air.\nThe daily travel estimates are from a mobile device data panel from merged multiple data sources that address the geographic and temporal sample variation issues often observed in a single data source. The merged data panel only includes mobile devices whose anonymized location data meet a set of data quality standards, which further ensures the overall data quality and consistency. The data quality standards consider both temporal frequency and spatial accuracy of anonymized location point observations, temporal coverage and representativeness at the device level, spatial representativeness at the sample and county level, etc. A multi-level weighting method that employs both device and trip-level weights expands the sample to the underlying population at the county and state levels, before travel statistics are computed.\nThese data are experimental and may not meet all of our quality standards.  Experimental data products are created using new data sources or methodologies that benefit data users in the absence of other relevant products. We are seeking feedback from data users and stakeholders on the quality and usefulness of these new products. Experimental data products that meet our quality standards and demonstrate sufficient user demand may enter regular production if resources permit.",

        "description": "The 2019 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.\nThe generalized ZCTA boundaries in this file are based on those delineated following the 2010 Census.",

This 20-minute online survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on American households.  The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment.

The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Firearm counts are derived from taking the number of violent crimes which involve a firearm. Population data are provided every year by the FBI, based on US Census information.

This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request. To make a request, please email dataportal@cityofchicago.org with the subject line: Violence Reduction Victims Access Request. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:\n\nIn instances where a homicide victimization does not correspond to an IUCR code 0110 or 0130, we set the IUCR code to \"01XX\"  to indicate that the victimization was a homicide but we do not know whether it was a first-degree murder",

Information on distribution by county from the following three databases was extracted and compiled into this dataset.  First, the New York Natural Heritage Program biodiversity database: Rare animals, rare plants, and significant natural communities. Significant natural communities are rare or high-quality wetlands, forests, grasslands, ponds, streams, and other types of habitats.  Next, the 2nd NYS Breeding Bird Atlas Project database: Birds documented as breeding during the atlas project from 2000-2005.  And last, DEC\u2019s NYS Reptile and Amphibian Database: Reptiles and amphibians; most records are from the NYS Amphibian & Reptile Atlas Project (Herp Atlas) from 1990-1999.",

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2018 or 2017 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2015 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the county level.

The dataset was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate were assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined.\nMap unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the entire map unit.\nThis dataset consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national dataset. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information system relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.  \nThese data provide information about soil features on or near the surface of the Earth. Data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state, regional, and national level. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:250,000-scale data.",

This dataset is created using data from the California Electronic Death Registration System (CA-EDRS) via the Vital Records Business Intelligence System (VRBIS). Substance-related deaths are identified by reviewing the cause of death. Deaths caused by opioids, methamphetamine, and cocaine are included. Homicides and suicides are excluded. Ethnic and racial groups with fewer than 10 events are not tallied separately for privacy reasons but are included in the \u201call races\u201d total.   \nUnintentional drug overdose death rates are calculated by dividing the total number of overdose deaths by race/ethnicity by the total population size for that demographic group and year and then multiplying by 100,000. The total population size is based on estimates from the US Census Bureau County Population Characteristics for San Francisco, 2022 Vintage by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. \nThese data differ from the data shared in the  Preliminary Unintentional Drug Overdose Death by Year dataset  since this dataset uses finalized counts of overdose deaths associated with cocaine, methamphetamine, and opioids only.  \nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED \nThis dataset is created by copying data from the Annual Substance Use Trends in San Francisco report from the San Francisco Department of Public Health Center on Substance Use and Health. \nC.

        "description": "The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a comprehensive aggregated collection of hydrologic unit data consistent with the national criteria for delineation and resolution. It defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point except in coastal or lake front areas where there could be multiple outlets as stated by the \"Federal Standards and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)\" \"Standard\" (https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/11/a3/). Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. This dataset represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the 12-digit for the entire United States. Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. WBD line attributes contain the highest level of hydrologic unit for each boundary, line source information and flow modifications.

These topics will be covered in Summary File 3. Data are available for states, counties, county subdivisions, places, census tracts, block groups, and, where applicable, American Indian and Alaskan Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands. The SF1 data are available on the Bureau's web site and may be retrieved from American FactFinder as tables, lists, or maps. Users may also download a set of compressed ASCII files for each state via the Bureau's FTP server. There are over 8000 data items available for each geographic area. The full listing of these data items is available here as a downloadable compressed data base file named TABLES.ZIP. The uncompressed is in FoxPro data base file (dbf) format and may be imported to ACCESS, EXCEL, and other software formats. While all of this information is useful, the Office of Community Planning and Development has downloaded selected information for all states and areas and is making this information available on the CPD web pages. The tables and data items selected are those items used in the CDBG and HOME allocation formulas plus topics most pertinent to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), the Consolidated Plan, and similar overall economic and community development plans. The information is contained in five compressed (zipped) dbf tables for each state. When uncompressed the tables are ready for use with FoxPro and they can be imported into ACCESS, EXCEL, and other spreadsheet, GIS and database software. The data are at the block group summary level. The first two characters of the file name are the state abbreviation. The next two letters are BG for block group. Each record is labeled with the code and name of the city and county in which it is located so that the data can be summarized to higher-level geography. The last part of the file name describes the contents . The GEO file contains standard Census Bureau geographic identifiers for each block group, such as the metropolitan area code and congressional district code. The only data included in this table is total population and total housing units. POP1 and POP2 contain selected population variables and selected housing items are in the HU file. The MA05 table data is only for use by State CDBG grantees for the reporting of the racial composition of beneficiaries of Area Benefit activities.

        "description": "Executive Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that holds promise for tremendous societal and economic benefit. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live, work, learn, discover, and communicate. AI research can further our national priorities, including increased economic prosperity, improved educational opportunities and quality of life, and enhanced national and homeland security. Because of these potential benefits, the U.S. government has invested in AI research for many years. Yet, as with any significant technology in which the Federal government has interest, there are not only tremendous opportunities but also a number of considerations that must be taken into account in guiding the overall direction of Federally-funded R&D in AI. On May 3, 2016,the Administration announced the formation of a new NSTC Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, to help coordinate Federal activity in AI.1 This Subcommittee, on June 15, 2016, directed the Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) to create a National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan. A NITRD Task Force on Artificial Intelligence was then formed to define the Federal strategic priorities for AI R&D, with particular attention on areas that industry is unlikely to address. This National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan establishes a set of objectives for Federallyfunded AI research, both research occurring within the government as well as Federally-funded research occurring outside of government, such as in academia. The ultimate goal of this research is to produce new AI knowledge and technologies that provide a range of positive benefits to society, while minimizing the negative impacts. To achieve this goal, this AI R&D Strategic Plan identifies the following priorities for Federally-funded AI research: Strategy 1: Make long-term investments in AI research. Prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a world leader in AI. Strategy 2: Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration. Rather than replace humans, most AI systems will collaborate with humans to achieve optimal performance. Research is needed to create effective interactions between humans and AI systems. Strategy 3: Understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. We expect AI technologies to behave according to the formal and informal norms to which we hold our fellow humans. Research is needed to understand the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI, and to develop methods for designing AI systems that align with ethical, legal, and societal goals. Strategy 4: Ensure the safety and security of AI systems. Before AI systems are in widespread use, assurance is needed that the systems will operate safely and securely, in a controlled, well-defined, and well-understood manner. Further progress in research is needed to address this challenge of creating AI systems that are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy. Strategy 5: Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing. The depth, quality, and accuracy of training datasets and resources significantly affect AI performance. Researchers need to develop high quality datasets and environments and enable responsible access to high-quality datasets as well as to testing and training resources. Strategy 6: Measure and evaluate AI technologies through standards and benchmarks. . Essential to advancements in AI are standards, benchmarks, testbeds, and community engagement that guide and evaluate progress in AI. Additional research is needed to develop a broad spectrum of evaluative techniques. Strategy 7: Better understand the national AI R&D workforce needs. Advances in AI will require a strong community of AI researchers. An improved understanding of current and future R&D workforce demands in AI is needed to help ensure that sufficient AI experts are available to address the strategic R&D areas outlined in this plan. The AI R&D Strategic Plan closes with two recommendations: Recommendation 1: Develop an AI R&D implementation framework to identify S&T opportunities and support effective coordination of AI R&D investments, consistent with Strategies 1-6 of this plan. Recommendation 2: Study the national landscape for creating and sustaining a healthy AI R&D workforce, consistent with Strategy 7 of this plan.",

Screen questions cover the following types of crimes, including attempts: rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.\nThe data include type of crime; severity of the crime; injuries or losses; time and place of occurrence; medical expenses incurred; number, age, race, and sex of offender(s); and relationship of offender(s) to the victim (stranger, casual acquaintance, relative, etc.). Demographic information on household members includes age, sex, race, education, employment, median family income, marital status, and military history. A stratified multistage cluster sample technique was employed, with the person-level files consisting of a full sample of victims and a 10 percent sample of nonvictims for up to four incidents.\nThe NCVS data are organized by collection quarter, and six quarters comprise an annual file. For example, for a 1979 file, the four quarters of 1979 are included as well as the first two quarters of 1980.\nNACJD has prepared a resource guide on NCVS.\nYears Produced: Updated annually",

The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas, based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.\nThe 1990 codes are similarly defined. However, the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And, census tracts changed in number and shapes. The 2000 rural-urban commuting codes are not directly comparable with the 1990 codes because of these differences.\nAn update of the Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes is planned for late 2013.",

It counts asthma-related visits to the Emergency Department (ED), hospitalizations, urgent care visits, and asthma controller medication dispensing events.\nThe asthma data was compiled as part of the Allegheny County Health Department\u2019s Asthma Task Force, which was established in 2018. The Task Force was formed to identify strategies to decrease asthma inpatient and emergency utilization among children (ages 0-18), with special focus on children receiving services funded by Medicaid. Data is being used to improve the understanding of asthma in Allegheny County, and inform the recommended actions of the task force. Data will also be used to evaluate progress toward the goal of reducing asthma-related hospitalization and ED visits.\nRegarding this data, asthma is defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (IDC-10) classification system code J45.xxx. The ICD-10 system is used to classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures in the U.S. healthcare system. \nChildren seeking care for an asthma-related claim in 2017 are represented in the data. Data is compiled by the Health Department from medical claims submitted to three health plans (UPMC, Gateway Health, and Highmark). Claims may also come from people enrolled in Medicaid plans managed by these insurers. The Health Department estimates that 74% of the County\u2019s population aged 0-18 is represented in the data.\nUsers should be cautious of using administrative claims data as a measure of disease prevalence and interpreting trends over time. Missing from the data are the uninsured, members in participating plans enrolled for less than 90 continuous days in 2017, children with an asthma-related condition that did not file a claim in 2017, and children participating in plans managed by insurers that did not share data with the Health Department. \nData users should also be aware that diagnoses may also be subject to misclassification, and that children with an asthmatic condition may not be diagnosed. It is also possible that some children may be counted more than once in the data if they are enrolled in a plan by more than one participating insurer and file a claim on each policy in the same calendar year.",

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.

Currently, the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) (2), is used by Food Surveys Research Group, ARS, to process dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES. Nutrient values for FNDDS are based on Survey-SR. Survey-SR was referred to as the \"Primary Data Set\" in older publications. Early versions of the dataset were composed mainly of commodity-type items such as wheat flour, sugar, milk, etc. However, with increased consumption of commercial processed and restaurant foods and changes in how national nutrition monitoring data are used (1), many commercial processed and restaurant items have been added to Survey-SR.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe current version, Survey-SR 2013-2014,\u00a0is mainly based on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) 28 (2) and contains sixty-six nutrientseach for 3,404 foods.

Several school lunch pizzas and chicken products, fast-food sandwiches, and new beef cuts were also added, as they are now reported more frequently by survey respondents. Nutrient profiles were updated for several commonly consumed foods such as cheddar, mozzarella and American cheese, ground beef, butter, and catsup. The changes in nutrient values may be due to reformulations in products, changes in the market shares of brands, or more accurate data. Examples of more accurate data include analytical data, market share data, and data from a nationally representative sample.",

        "description": "The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) is a unique and powerful database designed to support various types of analyses of national readmission rates for all payers and the uninsured. The NRD includes discharges for patients with and without repeat hospital visits in a year and those who have died in the hospital. Repeat stays may or may not be related. The criteria to determine the relationship between hospital admissions is left to the analyst using the NRD. This database addresses a large gap in health care data - the lack of nationally representative information on hospital readmissions for all ages.  Outcomes of interest include national readmission rates, reasons for returning to the hospital for care, and the hospital costs for discharges with and without readmissions. Unweighted, the NRD contains data from approximately 18 million discharges each year. Weighted, it estimates roughly 35 million discharges. Developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, HCUP data inform decision making at the national, State, and community levels. \nThe NRD is drawn from HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) containing verified patient linkage numbers that can be used to track a person across hospitals within a State, while adhering to strict privacy guidelines.  The NRD is not designed to support regional, State-, or hospital-specific readmission analyses.  \nThe NRD contains more than 100 clinical and non-clinical data elements provided in a hospital discharge abstract. Data elements include but are not limited to: diagnoses, procedures, patient demographics (e.g., sex, age), expected source of payer, regardless of expected payer, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay, or those billed as \u2018no charge, discharge month, quarter, and year, total charges, length of stay, and data elements essential to readmission analyses.

The relative sea level trend plots include the time series for each station of the monthly MSL with the seasonal cycle removed, a 5-month average, and the linear trend with its 95% confidence interval; the average seasonal cycle; the interannual variation of MSL. The plots are updated monthly and the long-term trend is recalculated every year.

The investigators sought to better understand the nature of the problem and clarify the types of shooting incidents occurring in schools,  provide information on the characteristics of school shooters, and compare fatal shooting incidents to events where only injuries resulted to identify intervention points that could be exploited to reduce the harm caused by shootings. To accomplish these objectives, the investigators used quantitative multivariate and qualitative case studies research methods to document where and when school violence occurs, and highlight key incident and perpetrator level characteristics to help law enforcement and school administrators differentiate between the kinds of school shootings that exist, to further policy responses that are appropriate for individuals and communities.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hawaii-volcanism-impact-on-the-environment",
        "description": "Fewer than one hundred people have been killed by eruptions in the recorded history of Hawaii, and only one death has occurred in the 20th Century. However, the lava flows are highly destructive to populated and cultivated areas. This set depicts the negative impact of lava flows on communities, vegetation, marine life, roads, and coastlines. It also illustrates the benefits of Hawaii volcanism such as the production of geothermal power, increase in land area of the islands and other benefits. More than 270,000 people have been killed directly or indirectly by volcanic activity worldwide during the past 500 years. Nearly all of the deaths have been caused by explosive eruptions of composite volcanoes along the boundaries of the Earth's tectonic plates. Hawaii's volcanoes have more fluid, less gaseous magmas and produce quieter, less hazardous eruptions. The village of Kapoho was entirely destroyed during the 1960 eruption in the lower east rift (fissure) zone of Kilauea. In the 1980s, flows from Kilauea's east rift largely destroyed Royal Gardens and Kalapana. The March-April 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa threatened Hilo, with a population of about 40,000. Advancing nearly 26 km in about 5 days, the active flows produced a bright red glow in the night sky visible from Hilo. Much to the relief of the citizens, the flows stopped about 6.5 km short of the city's outskirts. These outskirts are built in part on the pahoehoelava (smooth ropy lava) flows produced by the 1881 eruption of Mauna Loa, indicating that Hilo is well within the reach of lava flows from the volcano. Although the destructive effects of volcanism are more obvious, volcanoes also provide many benefits to mankind. They are the major contributors to the building of continents, and all oceanic islands owe their origin directly or indirectly to volcanism. Over the billions of years of Earth's existence, water has been released from its interior by volcanoes and hot springs near volcanic intrusions. Geothermal power produced by volcanism is an inexpensive alternative energy source. The Hawaiian Islands were built over millions of years by lava flows. The lava flows have provided the fertile soil in which crops such as pineapples, sugar cane, and coffee thrive, and lush tropical vegetation flourishes. The flows start to weather quickly in areas with adequate rainfall. In some cases revegetation can begin in less than one year after the eruption. The lava flows are very fertile, especially if they have been covered by ash. The fine ash particles retain water within reach of plant roots and release plant foods such as potassium. Vegetation that has been destroyed by ash falls returns in a more luxuriant form. However in the island's arid areas, it may take thousands of years to form fertile soils from erosion and breakdown of lava. Volcanic rocks provide an abundant local source of materials for landscaping, construction, and road building. The majestic mountains andbeautiful black sand beaches of Hawaii that draw thousands of tourists each year are products of volcanism. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park provides one of the few places in the world where visitors can safely view volcanic processes. The Hawaiian volcanoes are contributing to the overall understanding of volcanoes; they provide a natural laboratory for study of the eruptivephenomena. Careful research and constant observation over long periods of time are important. From these data, volcanologists are learning to interpret activity in order to advise local officials of imminent eruptions.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/solar-footprints-in-california-e32e6",
        "description": "Solar Footprints in CaliforniaThis GIS dataset consists of polygons that represent the footprints of solar powered electric generation facilities and related infrastructure in California called Solar Footprints. The location of solar footprints was identified using other existing solar footprint datasets from various sources along with imagery interpretation analysis. CEC staff reviewed footprints identified with imagery and digitized polygons to match the visual extent of each facility. Previous datasets of existing solar footprints used to locate solar facilities include:\u00a0\u00a0GIS Layers: (1) California Solar Footprints,\u00a0(2)\u00a0UC Berkeley Solar Points, (3)\u00a0Kruitwagen et al. 2021, (4)\u00a0BLM Renewable Project Facilities, (5)\u00a0Quarterly Fuel and Energy Report (QFER)Imagery Datasets:\u00a0Esri World Imagery,\u00a0USGS National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), 2020\u00a0SENTINEL 2 Satellite Imagery, 2023Solar facilities with large footprints such as parking lot solar, large rooftop solar, and ground solar were included in the solar footprints dataset. Small scale solar (less than 0.5 acre) and residential footprints were not included. No other data was used in the production of these shapes. Definitions for the solar facilities identified via imagery are subjective and described as follows:\u00a0Rooftop Solar: Solar arrays located on rooftops of large building.\u00a0Parking lot Solar: Solar panels on parking lots roughly larger than 1 acre, or clusters of solar panels in adjacent parking lots.\u00a0Ground Solar: Solar panels located on ground roughly larger than 1 acre, or large clusters of smaller scale footprints.\u00a0Once all footprints identified by the above criteria were digitized for all California counties, the features were visually classified into ground, parking and rooftop categories. The features were also classified into rural and urban types using the 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 1490 definition for rural. In addition, the distance to the closest substation and the percentile category of this distance (e.g. 0-25th percentile, 25th-50th percentile) was also calculated. The coverage provided by this data set should not be assumed to be a complete accounting of solar footprints in California. Rather, this dataset represents an attempt to improve upon existing solar feature datasets and to update the inventory of \"large\" solar footprints via imagery, especially in recent years since previous datasets were published.\u00a0This procedure produced a total solar project footprint of 129,742 acres. Attempts to classify these footprints and isolate the large utility-scale projects from the smaller rooftop solar projects identified in the data set is difficult. The data was gathered based on imagery, and project information that could link multiple adjacent solar footprints under one larger project is not known. However, partitioning all solar footprints that are at least partly outside of the techno-economic exclusions and greater than 7 acres yields a total footprint size of 114,470 acres. These can be approximated as utility-scale footprints.\u00a0\u00a0Metadata:\u00a0(1) California Solar FootprintsAbstract: Conservation Biology Institute created this dataset of solar footprints in California after it was found that no such dataset was publicly available at the time (Dec 2015-Jan 2016). This dataset is used to help identify where current ground based, mostly utility scale, solar facilities are being constructed and will be used in a larger landscape intactness model to help guide future development of renewable energy projects. The process of digitizing these footprints first began by utilizing an excel file from the California Energy Commission with lat/long coordinates of some of the older and bigger locations. After projecting those points and locating the facilities utilizing NAIP 2014 imagery, the developed area around each facility was digitized. While interpreting imagery, there were some instances where a fenced perimeter was clearly seen and was slightly larger than the actual footprint. For those cases the footprint followed the fenced perimeter since it limits wildlife movement through the area. In other instances, it was clear that the top soil had been scraped of any vegetation, even outside of the primary facility footprint. These footprints included the areas that were scraped within the fencing since, especially in desert systems, it has been near permanently altered.\u00a0Other sources that guided the search for solar facilities included the Energy Justice Map, developed by the Energy Justice Network which can be found here:https://www.energyjustice.net/map/searchobject.php?gsMapsize=large&amp;giCurrentpageiFacilityid;=1&amp;gsTable;=facility&amp;gsSearchtype;=advancedThe Solar Energy Industries Association\u2019s \u201cProject Location Map\u201d which can be found here:\u00a0https://www.seia.org/map/majorprojectsmap.phpalso assisted in locating newer facilities along with the \"Power Plants\" shapefile, updated in December 16th, 2015, downloaded from the U.S. Energy Information Administration located here:https://www.eia.gov/maps/layer_info-m.cfmThere were some facilities that were stumbled upon while searching for others, most of these are smaller scale sites located near farm infrastructure. Other sites were located by contacting counties that had solar developments within the county. Still, others were located by sleuthing around for proposals and company websites that had images of the completed facility. These helped to locate the most recently developed sites and these sites were digitized based on landmarks such as ditches, trees, roads and other permanent structures.Metadata:\u00a0(2)\u00a0UC Berkeley Solar PointsUC Berkeley report containing\u00a0point location for energy facilities across the United States.2022_utility-scale_solar_data_update.xlsm (live.com)Metadata:\u00a0(3)\u00a0Kruitwagen et al. 2021Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy generating capacity has grown by 41 per cent per year\u00a0since 2009. Energy system projections that mitigate climate change and aid universal\u00a0energy access show a nearly ten-fold increase in PV solar energy generating capacity\u00a0by 2040. Geospatial data describing the energy system are required to manage\u00a0generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with\u00a0biodiversity, conservation and land protection priorities caused by the land-use and\u00a0land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of\u00a0solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs. Here we provide a global\u00a0inventory of commercial-, industrial- and utility-scale PV installations (that is, PV\u00a0generating stations in excess of 10 kilowatts nameplate capacity) by using a\u00a0longitudinal corpus of remote sensing imagery, machine learning and a large cloud\u00a0computation infrastructure. We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432\u00a0per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the help\u00a0of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be\u00a0423\u2009gigawatts (\u221275/+77\u2009gigawatts) at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our dataset with\u00a0estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity\u00a0to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV solar energy facilities are\u00a0sited on cropland, followed by arid lands\u00a0and grassland.

        "description": "In 2021, Allegheny County Economic Development (ACED), in partnership with Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh(URA), completed the a Market Value Analysis (MVA) for Allegheny County.  This analysis services as both an update to previous MVA\u2019s commissioned separately by ACED and the URA and combines the MVA for the whole of Allegheny County (inclusive of the City of Pittsburgh). The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality\u2019s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional community boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.  \nThis MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market. The  data used covers the 2017-2019 period, and data used in the analysis includes:\n\nResidential Real Estate Sales\nMortgage Foreclosures\nResidential Vacancy\nParcel Year Built\nParcel Condition\nBuilding Violations\nOwner Occupancy\nSubsidized Housing Units\n\nThe MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.\nPlease refer to the presentation and executive summary for more information about the data, methodology, and findings.",

        "description": "The Methow mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) sub-herd is part of the larger West Okanogan herd, the largest migratory mule deer herd in Washington State. Individuals travel as far as 65 miles twice annually between lowland winter range and higher elevation summer range (fig. 27). Mule deer wintering on the shrubsteppe dominated foothills in the lower half of the Methow valley undertake a roughly 3-week trek in mid-spring to the productive subalpine and alpine meadows of the Pasayten and Chelan Sawtooth Wilderness, and surrounding high country, with some animals traveling north into British Columbia. On summer range they mingle with deer moving up from the west side of the Okanogan valley forming an estimated summering population of between 15,000\u201325,000 animals. Currently, migrating deer in the Methow watershed do not have to contend with any known major barriers, but their movements are somewhat constrained in the lower portion of the watershed where the topography narrows the valley considerably.These data provide the location of migration routes for mule deer in the Methow population in Washington. They were developed from 321 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 97 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 2 hours.",

The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.\nThe Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department\u2019s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile refer to areas that are administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian/Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy. The State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provides the legal boundaries for the HHLs. The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineated for the 2010 Census through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) by participants from the federally recognized tribal governments. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list of federally recognized tribes and only provides legal boundary information when the tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation, or when another tribal, state, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or off-reservation trust land.\nThe boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2018, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\nThe boundaries for state-recognized American Indian reservations and for SDTSAs were delineated by a state governor-appointed liaisons for the 2010 Census through the State American Indian Reservation Program and TSAP respectively.",

        "description": "The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) 2006-10 measures the social vulnerability of U.S. counties to environmental hazards. The index is a comparative metric that facilitates the examination of the differences in social vulnerability among counties. SoVI is a valuable tool for policy makers and practitioners. It graphically illustrates the geographic variation in social vulnerability. It shows where there is uneven capacity for preparedness and response and where resources might be used most effectively to reduce the pre-existing vulnerability. SoVI also is useful as an indicator in determining the differential recovery from disasters.The index synthesizes 27 socioeconomic variables, which the research literature suggests contribute to reduction in a community's ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards. SoVI data sources include primarily those from the United States Census Bureau.The data are compiled and processed by the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. The data are standardized and placed into a principal components analysis to reduce the initial set of variables into a smaller set of statistically optimized components. Adjustments are made to the components' cardinality (positive (+) or negative (-)) to insure that positive component loadings are associated with increased vulnerability, and negative component loadings are associated with decreased vulnerability. Once the cardinalities of the components are determined, the components are added together to determine the numerical social vulnerability score for each county.SoVI 2006-10 marks a change in the formulation of the SoVI metric from earlier versions. New directions in the theory and practice of vulnerability science emphasize the constraints of family structure, language barriers, vehicle availability, medical disabilities, and healthcare access in the preparation for and response to disasters, thus necessitating the inclusion of such factors in SoVI. Extensive testing of earlier conceptualizations of SoVI, in addition to the introduction of the U.S. Census Bureau's five-year American Community Survey (ACS) estimates, warrants changes to the SoVI recipe, resulting in a more robust metric. These changes, pioneered with the ACS-based SoVI 2005-09 carry over to SoVI 2006-10, which combines the best data available from both the 2010 U.S. Decennial Census and five-year estimates from the 2006-2010 ACS.",

        "description": "Information on the past and present orientation of the Earth's magnetic field is available from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) which serves as the national data bank for geomagnetic data. The Earth's magnetic field has been measured by land surveys, ships, aircraft and satellites at hundreds of locations resulting in millions of observations. Many of the observations are of poor quality or are unevenly distributed around the globe. Because of these limiting factors and the variation of the main magnetic field with time, the Earth's field is usually approximated by mathematical models. These models, adjusted to fit selected available observations, have wide application in geophysical and space sciences. Surveyors can obtain data and information for individual specific locations worldwide. Past values of the magnetic field are available from models for areas within the conterminous U.S. from 1750 or from 1945 worldwide. These mathematical models must be periodically updated due to the changing nature of the Earth's magnetic field. NGDC maintains the models and data base of observations to track secular variation of the Earth's magnetic field. Models and software are available on-line. The global geomagnetic observations data bases for secular change studies include high-quality magnetic observations made at observatories worldwide since 1800. Other geomagnetic data bases are: IAGA Repeat Station data base which contains observations from exact reoccupations, Other land Surveys containing miscellaneous land observations worldwide since 1800 including a few thousand observations made at sea by the non-magnetic ships, Carnegie and Zarya, Vector airborne surveys from the Project Magnetic aircraft, satellite and selected marine observations. Most of the surface data are available on-line. At most locations, three magnetic elements were observed: Either declination (D), Inclination (I), and horizontal intensity (H), or declination, horizontal intensity, and vertical intensity (Z), or total intensity (F). Where possible, the values for other magnetic elements, usually the north component (X) and east component (Y), were derived by the computer. The altitude, latitude, and longitude are recorded for each observation. The observatory annual means file contains the results of more of the observatories operating since 1800. Files are revised as new data become available. Searches and plots of data from selected stations can be made. These secular change files are the principal source for tracking the long-period changes in the direction and intensity of the Earth's magnetic field. Other data include a digital bibliography of historical magnetic survey publications at NGDC and the co-located World Data Center-A. Over 750 reports published from the 1830's to 1980's were inventoried in a digital bibliography and digitally imaged in .PCX format. The digital images of these reports have been written to magnetic tape.",

        "description": "The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2014 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.\nThis study has 1 Data Set.",

This composite index was developed by U.S. EPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Research and Development in support of its Sustainable and Healthy Communities (SHC) Research. It serves as an endpoint measure for use in the creation of community decision-support tools. The HWBI characterizes community conditions in the context of the flow of economic, social and ecological services. The index calculation approach used a nested-indicator design. A decade (2000-2010) of cultural, economic, and social data were drawn from publicly available sources (e.g., US Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, American Community Survey, General Social Survey, Centers for Disease Control) to provide the foundation for well-being related indicators. Indicators are integrated into one of eight domains or sub-indices of well-being. These domains were synthesized to represent different aspects of well-being characteristics common across communities of all sizes. Service indicators reflect the availability of select socio-ecological services that influence well-being. Community decisions often result in changes in the flow of community services. Collectively, well-being and service measures provide a means to evaluate relationships between the availability of certain community services and overall well-being. Data used to generate service indicators were also collected from existing data sources. Detailed information about the attributes of the HWBI, its components and related service indicators are described in Indicators and Methods for Constructing a U.S. Human Well-being Index (HWBI) for Ecosystem Services Research (EPA/600/R-12/023. pp. 121) and Indicators and Methods for Evaluating Economic, Ecosystem and Social Services Provisioning (EPA/600/R-14/184. pp. 174), respectively.",

PPIs measure price change from the perspective of the seller. This contrasts with other measures, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), that measure price change from the purchaser's perspective. Sellers' and purchasers' prices may differ due to government subsidies, sales and excise taxes, and distribution costs.\nThere are three main PPI classification structures which draw from the same pool of price information provided to the BLS by cooperating company reporters:\n    Industry classification. A Producer Price Index for an industry is a measure of changes in prices received for the industry's output sold outside the industry (that is, its net output). The PPI publishes approximately 535 industry price indexes in combination with over 4,000 specific product line and product category sub-indexes, as well as, roughly 500 indexes for groupings of industries. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) index codes provide comparability with a wide assortment of industry-based data for other economic programs, including productivity, production, employment, wages, and earnings.\n    Commodity classification. The commodity classification structure of the PPI organizes products and services by similarity or material composition, regardless of the industry classification of the producing establishment. This system is unique to the PPI and does not match any other standard coding structure. In all, PPI publishes more than 3,700 commodity price indexes for goods and about 800 for services (seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted), organized by product, service, and end use.\n    Commodity-based Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) System. Commodity-based FD-ID price indexes regroup commodity indexes for goods, services, and construction at the subproduct class (six-digit) level, according to the type of buyer and the amount of physical processing or assembling the products have undergone. The PPI publishes over 600 FD-ID indexes (seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted) measuring price change for goods, services, and construction sold to final demand and to intermediate demand. The FD-ID system replaced the PPI stage-of-processing (SOP) system as PPI's primary aggregation model with the release of data for January 2014. The FD-ID system expands coverage in its aggregate measures beyond that of the SOP system by incorporating indexes for services, construction, exports, and government purchases.\n\nFor more information, visit: https://www.bls.gov/ppi",

The VA commitment to quality propelled the implementation of the RAI/MDS in its nursing homes now known as VA Community Living Centers (CLC). In addition to providing consistent clinical information, the RAI/MDS can be used as a measure of both quality and resource utilization, thereby serving as a benchmark for quality and cost data within the VA as well as with community based nursing facilities. Workload based on RAI/MDS can be calculated electronically by the interactions of the elements of the MDS data and grouped into 53 categories referred to as Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV). Residents are assessed quarterly. The data is grouped for analysis at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). Conversion to electronic data entry and transmission to the AITC was completed system-wide by year-end 2000. In 2010, the Centeres for Medicare and Medicaide Services released a significantly upgraded version, MDS 3.0, to begin to be implemented on October 1, 2011 in VHA CLCs.

Water samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties, major inorganic ions, selected trace elements, and dissolved organic carbon. Selected trace elements included antimony, arsenic, cadmium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, and zinc. Stream bed-sediment and soil samples were analyzed for major inorganic ions, selected trace elements, and grain size distribution.Surface-water samples were collected near the downstream transect of each stream reach. Monitoring wells were located adjacent to the stream reach and in close proximity to the surface-water sampling sites. Bulk bed-sediment samples were collected during normal low-flow conditions. Each sample consisted of a composite sample from five locations (right edge, left edge, and center of a middle transect, then upstream and downstream of the middle transect) within each stream reach. Three soil samples, one from hilltops, one from side slopes, and one from riparian zones, were collected from areas adjacent to each stream reach.  Each soil sample consisted of 5 to 10 grab samples collected by a 21-inch-long, 5/8-inch internal diameter stainless-steel hand auger and composited in Teflon lined pans. All samples were collected following USGS sampling protocols.This data release provides database and mapping information for assessment of trace element concentrations in stream water, bed sediment, groundwater, and soil found in relatively pristine and undisturbed watersheds in proximity to watersheds used for military training.",

The outer limit of each of these zones is measured from the U.S. normal baseline, which coincides with the low water line depicted on NOAA charts and includes closing lines across the entrances of legal bays and rivers, consistent with international law. The U.S. baseline and associated maritime limits are reviewed and approved through the interagency U.S. Baseline Committee, which is chaired by the U.S. Department of State.  The Committee serves the function of gaining interagency consensus on the proper location of the baseline using the provisions of the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, to ensure that the seaward extent of U.S. maritime zones do not exceed the breadth that is permitted by international law.  In 2002 and in response to mounting requests for digital maritime zones, NOAA launched a project to re-evaluate the U.S. baseline in partnership with other federal agencies via the U.S. Baseline Committee.  The focus of the baseline evaluation was NOAA's largest scale, most recent edition nautical charts as well as supplemental source materials for verification of certain charted features.  This dataset is a result of the 2002-present initiative and reflects a multi-year iterative project whereby the baseline and associated maritime limits were re-evaluated on a state or regional basis. In addition to the U.S. maritime limits, the U.S. maritime boundaries with opposite or adjacent countries as well as the US/Canada International Boundary (on land and through the Great Lakes) are also included in this dataset.",

Caution should be taken when making comparisons of percentages calculated using the 2019 and 2020 census estimates since observed difference may result from the shift in the denominator.

From 6/1/2022, 2020 DPH provisional census estimates are used. \nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster.

Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations.\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.

Some boundary delineations based on the SLA were approximated in this data set, including areas in Hawaii, Alaska, and Washington State. Although state boarders do not extend over water, it was necessary to approximate these borders to produce this data set. \nThe boundaries depicted in this data set are for visual purposes only. The placement of these boundaries was extrapolated from the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Administrative Boundaries as described here http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/05-24659.pdf. The delineation between waters under US sovereign territory jurisdiction and that of federal governance is also approximate. Although based upon legislation, these data do not represent legal boundaries, especially in the case of Navassa Island, The Northern Mariana Islands, Baker Island, Howland Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Palmyra Atoll, Wake Islands and Jarvis Island.The seaward limit of this data set is the boundary of the 200nm US Exclusive Economic Zone. The EEZ is measured from the US baseline, recognized as the low-water line along the coast as marked on NOAA's nautical charts in accordance with articles of the Laws of the Sea. These limits are ambulatory and subject to revision based on changes in coastline geometry. This dataset was produced based on an update to the Maritime Limits published in September, 2013. \nTo view the most up-to-date Maritime Limits, please see http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/mbound.htm. Navassa Island does not have an EEZ around it, so the seaward extent of the federal waters surrounding it were based on the 12 mile offshore boundary of the USFWS National Wildlife Refuge established on the island. All data is displayed in WGS_1984_World_Mercator. Area calculations for all states except Alaska were completed in the same projection.

Transportation accidents are the second leading cause of death in California for people under the age of 45 and account for an average of 4,018 deaths per year (2006-2010). Risks of injury in traffic collisions are greatest for motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and lowest for bus and rail passengers. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience 4 times the death rate as Whites or Asians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians.

        "description": "Data is collected because of public interest in how the City\u2019s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees. Data is input into the City's Personnel Management System (\u201cPMS\u201d) by the respective user Agencies. Each record represents the following statistics for every city employee: Agency, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Agency Start Date, Work Location Borough, Job Title Description, Leave Status as of the close of the FY (June 30th), Base Salary, Pay Basis, Regular Hours Paid, Regular Gross Paid, Overtime Hours worked, Total Overtime Paid, and Total Other Compensation (i.e. lump sum and/or retro payments). This data can be used to analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime. The reader of this data should be aware that increments of salary increases received over the course of any one fiscal year will not be reflected. All that is captured, is the employee's final base and gross salary at the end of the fiscal year.  In very limited cases, a check replacement and subsequent refund may reflect both the original check as well as the re-issued check in employee pay totals.  \nNOTE 1: To further improve the visibility into the number of employee OT hours worked, beginning with the FY 2023 report, an updated methodology will be used which will eliminate redundant reporting of OT hours in some specific instances.  In the previous calculation, hours associated with both overtime pay as well as an accompanying overtime \u201ccompanion code\u201d pay were included in the employee total even though they represented pay for the same period of time.  With the updated methodology, the dollars shown on the Open Data site will continue to be inclusive of both types of overtime, but the OT hours will now reflect a singular block of time, which will result in a more representative total of employee OT hours worked.   The updated methodology will primarily impact the OT hours associated with City employees in uniformed civil service titles.  The updated methodology will be applied to the Open Data posting for Fiscal Year 2023 and cannot be applied to prior postings and, as a result, the reader of this data should not compare OT hours  prior to the 2023 report against OT hours published starting Fiscal Year 2023.  The reader of this data may continue to compare OT dollars across all published Fiscal Years on Open Data. \nNOTE 2: As a part of FISA-OPA\u2019s routine process for reviewing and releasing Citywide Payroll Data, data for some agencies (specifically NYC Police Department (NYPD) and the District Attorneys\u2019 Offices (Manhattan, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Bronx, and Special Narcotics)) have been redacted since they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law, POL \u00a7 87(2)(f), on the ground that disclosure of the information could endanger the life and safety of the public servants listed thereon. They are further exempt from disclosure pursuant to POL \u00a7 87(2)(e)(iii), on the ground that any release of the information would identify confidential sources or disclose confidential information relating to a criminal investigation, and POL \u00a7 87(2)(e)(iv), on the ground that disclosure would reveal non-routine criminal investigative techniques or procedures.

The AMPM is a fully computerized method for collecting 24-hour dietary recalls either in-person or by telephone. \nFor each 2-year data release cycle, the following dietary intake data files are available:\nIndividual Foods File - Contains one record per food for each survey participant. Foods are identified by USDA food codes. Each record contains information about when and where the food was consumed, whether the food was eaten in combination with other foods, amount eaten, and amounts of nutrients provided by the food.\nTotal Nutrient Intakes File - Contains one record per day for each survey participant. Each record contains daily totals of food energy and nutrient intakes, daily intake of water, intake day of week, total number foods reported, and whether intake was usual, much more than usual or much less than usual.

        "description": "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is increasingly dependent upon data.  Most of its employees generate and use vast amounts of data on a daily basis.  To improve our capacity for data analysis while providing the most efficient and the highest quality health care to our Veteran patients, VHA, working with the VA Office of Information and Technology, implemented a health data warehouse.  Central to this plan is consolidating data from disparate sources into a coherent single logical data model.  The Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) is the physical implementation of this logical data model at the enterprise level for VHA.   Although the CDW initially began to store data as early as 2006, a renewed effort began in 2010 to accelerate CDW's content by including more subject areas from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and content from other existing national data systems.  CDW supports fully developed subject areas in its production environment as well as supporting rapid prototyping by extracting data directly from source systems with very minor data transformations.  The Regional Data Warehouses and the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Data Warehouses share content from CDW and allow for greater reporting flexibility at the local level throughout the VHA organization.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.  \nThe boundaries of most incorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2021, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2020 Census.",

Population numbers peaked in the 1960s, but have declined in recent decades (Ramsey and others, 1981; California Department of Fish and Wildlife unpublished data). These mule deer migrate from a lower elevation winter range in the foothills east of the Sacramento Valley to upper elevation summer ranges in the southern Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada. Although portions of the herd winter on the California Department of Fish and Wildlife\u2019s Tehama Wildlife Area and other public lands, the winter range also comprises many private ranchlands. The herd\u2019s summer range includes significant portions of Lassen National Forest as well as Lassen Volcanic National Park and private timberlands. Primarily oak woodlands and annual grasslands characterize the winter range, while the summer range consists of conifer forests, montane meadows, and montane chaparral. Potential threats to the herd include habitat changes resulting from fire management (including fire suppression and catastrophic wildfires), forest succession, vegetation management, and climate change. A small percentage of the herd are residents, inhabiting areas along the Sacramento River and areas of irrigated agriculture.These mapping layers show the location of the migration stopovers for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the East Tehama population in California. They were developed from 63 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 33 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 1-23 hours.",

SUMMARY\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\nC. UPDATE PROCESS\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET\nInterpreting dates in this dataset\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.\nCompanion systems inventory dataset\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online as well.",

RSEI incorporates information from EPA\u2019s TRI database, which tracks certain toxic chemical releases and waste management activities at federal facilities and larger industrial facilities across the United States and its territories. RSEI incorporates over 30 years of TRI data, three U.S. censuses, toxicity and physicochemical properties for more than 400 toxic chemicals, and geographical information for more than 50,000 facilities and thousands of streams and other water bodies. All of this information is used to model and map the environmental fate and transport of each toxic chemical through the environment and the potential impacts that may result. The RSEI model calculates numeric results that are designed to be compared to other RSEI model generated results. These RSEI results are designed to help users contextualize, understand, and better communicate the relative hazards and potential for risks posed by certain waste management activities of TRI chemicals (e.g., from releases to the environment). RSEI results and custom analyses can be used for screening-level activities such as trend analyses that compare potential risk-related impacts from year to year, or for ranking and prioritizing toxic chemicals, facilities, industry sectors, or geographic regions for strategic planning. RSEI can also be used in conjunction with other data sources and environmental information, to help policy makers, researchers, and communities establish priorities for further investigation and to look at changes in potential health impacts over time.",

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2013 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.",

        "description": "The U.S. Hourly Climate Normals for 1981 to 2010 are 30-year averages of meteorological parameters for thousands of U.S. stations located across the 50 states, as well as U.S. territories, commonwealths, the Compact of Free Association nations, and one station inCanada. NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

        "description": "A. SUMMARY \nThis dataset includes data on a variety of substance use services funded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). This dataset only includes Drug MediCal-certified residential treatment, withdrawal management, and methadone treatment. Other private non-Drug Medi-Cal treatment providers may operate in the city. Withdrawal management discharges are inclusive of anyone who left withdrawal management after admission and may include someone who left before completing withdrawal management. \nThis dataset also includes naloxone distribution from the SFDPH Behavioral Health Services Naloxone Clearinghouse and the SFDPH-funded Drug Overdose Prevention and Education program. Both programs distribute naloxone to various community-based organizations who then distribute naloxone to their program participants. Programs may also receive naloxone from other sources. Data from these other sources is not included in this dataset. \nFinally, this dataset includes the number of clients on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). \nThe number of people who were treated with methadone at a Drug Medi-Cal certified Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) by year is populated by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) Behavioral Health Services Quality Management (BHSQM) program. OTPs in San Francisco are required to submit patient billing data in an electronic medical record system called Avatar. BHSQM calculates the number of people who received methadone annually based on Avatar data. Data only from Drug MediCal certified OTPs were included in this dataset. \nThe number of people who receive buprenorphine by year is populated from the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), administered by the California Department of Justice. All licensed prescribers in California are required to document controlled substance prescriptions in CURES. The Center on Substance Use and Health calculates the total number of people who received a buprenorphine prescription annually based on CURES data. Formulations of buprenorphine that are prescribed only for pain management are excluded.  \nPeople may receive buprenorphine and methadone in the same year, so you cannot add the Buprenorphine Clients by Year, and Methadone Clients by Year data together to get the total number of unique people receiving medications for opioid use disorder. \nFor more information on where to find treatment in San Francisco, visit findtreatment-sf.org.\u202f \nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED \nThis dataset is created by copying the data into this dataset from the SFDPH Behavioral Health Services Quality Management Program, the California Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), and the Office of Overdose Prevention. \nC. UPDATE PROCESS \nResidential Substance Use Treatment, Withdrawal Management, Methadone, and Naloxone data are updated quarterly with a 45-day delay. Buprenorphine data are updated quarterly and when the state makes this data available, usually at a 5-month delay. \nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET \nThroughout the year this dataset may include partial year data for methadone and buprenorphine treatment. As both methadone and buprenorphine are used as long-term treatments for opioid use disorder, many people on treatment at the end of one calendar year will continue into the next. For this reason, doubling (methadone), or quadrupling (buprenorphine) partial year data will not accurately project year-end totals.  \nE. RELATED DATASETS \nOverdose-Related 911 Responses by Emergency Medical Services \nUnintentional Overdose Death Rates by Race/Ethnicity \nPreliminary Unintentional Drug Overdose Deaths",

All-site\nage-adjusted cancer incidence rates were abstracted separately for males and females.\nCounty-level annual age-adjusted all-site cancer incidence rates for years 2006\u20132010 were\navailable for 2687 of 3142 (85.5%) counties in the U.S. Counties for which there are fewer\nthan 16 reported cases in a specific area-sex-race category are suppressed to ensure\nconfidentiality and stability of rate estimates; this accounted for 14 counties in our study.\nTwo states, Kansas and Virginia, do not provide data because of state legislation and\nregulations which prohibit the release of county level data to outside entities. Data from\nMichigan does not include cases diagnosed in other states because data exchange\nagreements prohibit the release of data to third parties. Finally, state data is not available for\nthree states, Minnesota, Ohio, and Washington. The age-adjusted average annual\nincidence rate for all counties was 453.7 per 100,000 persons.\nWe selected 2006\u20132010 as it is subsequent in time to the EQI exposure data which was\nconstructed to represent the years 2000\u20132005. We also gathered data for the three leading\ncauses of cancer for males (lung, prostate, and colorectal) and females (lung, breast, and\ncolorectal). \nThe EQI was used as an exposure metric as an indicator of cumulative environmental\nexposures at the county-level representing the period 2000 to 2005. A complete description\nof the datasets used in the EQI are provided in Lobdell et al.  and methods used for index\nconstruction are described by Messer et al. The EQI was developed for the period 2000\u2013\n2005 because it was the time period for which the most recent data were available when\nindex construction was initiated. The EQI includes variables representing each of the\nenvironmental domains. The air domain includes 87 variables representing criteria and\nhazardous air pollutants. The water domain includes 80 variables representing overall water\nquality, general water contamination, recreational water quality, drinking water quality,\natmospheric deposition, drought, and chemical contamination. The land domain includes 26\nvariables representing agriculture, pesticides, contaminants, facilities, and radon. The built\ndomain includes 14 variables representing roads, highway/road safety, public transit\nbehavior, business environment, and subsidized housing environment. The\nsociodemographic environment includes 12 variables representing socioeconomics and\ncrime.

        "description": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf \nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

SUMMARY\nLaw Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service \u2013 Real-time dataset includes all calls for service  which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (\u2018On-View\u2019).  \nThe Real-time dataset is delayed by 10 minutes, and represents a rolling 48 hour window of calls for service.  It contains both open and closed calls and is updated every 10 minutes.  It is delayed by 10 minutes. Open calls are active calls that are unverified, but being worked by law enforcement. Closed calls are calls that law enforcement have indicated are resolved.  Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. The dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and others. All relevant time intervals are also included. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. \nPlease refer Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer for full documentation \nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED\nOnce a received 911 call is dispatched, a record (CAD#) is generated in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System.   \nC. UPDATE PROCESS \nUpdated every 10 minutes with the past 48hrs of open and closed calls that have been dispatched. \nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET \nPlease refer Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer for full documentation \nE.

The index, which is seasonally adjusted, combines available data on freight traffic, as well as passenger travel, that have been weighted to yield a monthly measure of transportation services output.\nFor charts and discussion on the relationship of the TSI to the economy, see our Transportation as an Economic Indicator: Transportation Services Index page  (https://data.bts.gov/stories/s/TET-indicator-1/9czv-tjte)\nFor release schedule see: https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/transportation-services-index-release-schedule\nAbout seasonally-adjusted data\nStatisticians use the process of seasonal-adjustment to uncover trends in data. Monthly data, for instance, are influenced by the number of days and the number of weekends in a month as well as by the timing of holidays and seasonal activity. These influences make it difficult to see underlying changes in the data. Statisticians use seasonal adjustment to control for these influences.\nControlling of seasonal influences allows measurement of real monthly changes; short and long term patterns of growth or decline; and turning points. Data for one month can be compared to data for any other month in the series and the data series can be ranked to find high and low points. Any observed differences are \u201creal\u201d differences; that is, they are differences brought about by changes in the data and not brought about by a change in the number of days or weekends in the month, the occurrence or non-occurrence of a holiday, or seasonal activity.",

Members of the public interested in the identity of a specific incident may contact ACRC directly to inquire about the incident and, if it is closed, ACRC will release a copy of the file to the person requesting it. However, location data regarding where the incident was reported or occurred is included within this data set, which may or may not be the same location as the animal owner's home or property.\nIn addition, to protect the identity of the complainant (person filing the complaint or alerting ACRC to a potential incident), only the complainant's street name is included as part of this data set. \nFinally, while all incidents are updated on a daily basis, incidents involving animal cruelty are updated based on a rolling 30-day delay to allow for ACRC to investigate the incident and make a determination as to the validity of the cruelty complaint.",

The study employed a cross-sectional, survey research design, collecting data via a paper-pencil survey. The survey targeted all youth who attended school on a single day and achieved an 84 percent response rate.",

By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/). Relevant directives include: \n\u2022   Special Order S06-01-11 \u2013 CLEAR Automated Arrest System: describes the application used by Department members to enter arrest data. \n\u2022   Special Order S06-01-04 \u2013 Arrestee Identification Process: describes processes related to obtaining and using CB numbers. \n\u2022   Special Order S09-03-04 \u2013 Assignment and Processing of Records Division Numbers: describes processes related to obtaining and using RD numbers. \n\u2022   Special Order 06-01 \u2013 Processing Persons Under Department Control: describes required tasks associated with arrestee processing, include the requirement that Department members order charges based on severity.",

A set of training examples---examples with known output values---is used by a learning algorithm to generate a model. This model is intended to approximate the mapping between the inputs and outputs. This model can be used to generate predicted outputs for inputs that have not been seen before. Within supervised learning, one type of task is a classification learning task, in which each output consists of one or more classes to which the corresponding input belongs. For example, we may have data consisting of observations of sunspots.  In a classification learning task, our goal may be to learn to classify sunspots into one of several types.  Each example may correspond to one candidate sunspot with various measurements or just an image.  A learning algorithm would use the supplied examples to generate a model that approximates the mapping between each supplied set of measurements and the type of sunspot.  This model can then be used to classify previously unseen sunspots based on the candidate's measurements. In this chapter, we explain several basic classification algorithms.",

        "description": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists. \nThe ZCTA boundaries in this release are those delineated following the 2010 Census.",

        "Project URL": "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violence-reduction-victim-demographics-aggregated",
        "description": "This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January \u2013 March, April \u2013 June, July \u2013 September, October \u2013 December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.\nThis dataset includes a \" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table. \nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset",

Depletion is directly calculated using calibrated groundwater models, analytical approaches, or volumetric budget analyses for multiple aquifer systems. Estimated groundwater depletion in the United States during 1900\u20132008 totals approximately 1,000 cubic kilometers (km3). Furthermore, the rate of groundwater depletion has increased markedly since about 1950, with maximum rates occurring during the most recent period (2000\u20132008) when the depletion rate averaged almost 25 km3 per year (compared to 9.2 km3 per year averaged over the 1900\u20132008 timeframe).",

        "description": "Climate change threatens coral reefs through multiple pathways and interactions with local stressors. More resilient reefs have a higher likelihood of returning to a coral-dominated state following disturbance. To advance practical approaches to reef resilience assessments and aid resilience-based management of coral reefs, we conducted a resilience assessment for Puerto Rico\u2019s coral reefs modified from methods used in other U.S. jurisdictions. We calculated relative resilience scores for 103 sites from an existing commonwealth-wide survey using eight resilience indicators and identified which indicators most drove resilience. We found that sites of very different relative resilience were generally highly intermixed, underscoring the importance and necessity of decision making and management at fine scales. In combination with information on levels of two localized stressors (fishing pressure and pollution exposure), we used the resilience indicators to assess which of seven potential management actions could be used at each site to maintain or improve resilience. Fishery management was the management action that applied to the most sites. Furthermore, we combined sites\u2019 resilience scores with ocean warming predictions to assign sites to vulnerability categories. Island-wide or local managers can use the actions and vulnerability information as a starting point for resilience-based management of their reefs. This assessment differs from many previous ones because we tested how much information could be yielded by a \u201cdesktop\u201d assessment using freely-available, existing data rather than from a customized, resilience-focused field\nsurvey. The available data still permitted analyses comparable to previous assessments, demonstrating that desktop resilience assessments can substitute for assessments with field components under some circumstances. \nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGibbs, D., and J.

The study assessed\n familial and nonfamilial types of violence. It was designed as a\n telephone survey of American youth aged 12-17 living in United States\n households and residing with a parent or guardian. One parent or\n guardian in each household was interviewed briefly to establish\n rapport, secure permission to interview the targeted adolescent, and\n to ensure the collection of comparative data to examine potential\n nonresponse bias from households without adolescent participation.\n All interviews with both parents and adolescents were conducted using\n Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) technology. From the\n surveys of parents and adolescents, the principal investigators\n created one data file by attaching the data from the parents to the\n records of their respective adolescents. Adolescents were asked\n whether violence and drug abuse were problems in their schools and\n communities and what types of violence they had personally\n witnessed. They were also asked about other stressful events in their\n lives, such as the loss of a family member, divorce, unemployment,\n moving to a new home or school, serious illness or injury, and natural\n disaster. Questions regarding history of sexual assault, physical\n assault, and harsh physical discipline elicited a description of the\n event and perpetrator, extent of injuries, age at abuse, whether\n alcohol or drugs were involved, and who was informed of the\n incident. Information was also gathered on the delinquent behavior of\n respondents and their friends, including destruction of property,\n assault, theft, sexual assault, and gang activity. Other questions\n covered history of personal and family substance use and mental health\n indicators, such as major depression, post-traumatic stress disorders,\n weight changes, sleeping disorders, and problems\n concentrating. Demographic information was gathered from the\n adolescents on age, race, gender, number of people living in\n household, and grade in school. Parents were asked whether they were\n concerned about violent crime, affordable child care, drug abuse,\n educational quality, gangs, and the safety of their children at\n school. In addition, they were questioned about their own\n victimization experiences and whether they discussed personal safety\n issues with their children. Parents also supplied demographic\n information on gender, marital status, number of children, employment\nstatus, education, race, and income.",
